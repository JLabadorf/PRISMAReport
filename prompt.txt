This is a paper. Please list if it meets each of the PICO/PECO criteria, and then classify them as passing or failing. It must pass every point to be included. Allow for Interventions and/or Exposures. A study should be included if the PICO/PECO question can be answered by the data (e.g., a study of adults, which reports out the age group of 65+ would still be included). Allow for the studies which measure association as well a causation. For the assessment check to see if it qualifies each of the Population, Intervention/Exposure, Comparator, and Outcome categories as determined by the inclusion and exclusion criteria (must match all inclusion and no exclusion). Explain your rationale and whether it passes or fails.
