39349418,Karaca et al.,"Physical Activity, Kinesiophobia, Pain Catastrophizing, Body Awareness, Depression and Disease Activity in Patients With Ankylosing Spondylitis and Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Cross-Sectional Explorative Study.","The aim was to compare the levels of physical activity, kinesiophobia, pain catastrophizing, body awareness, and depression in patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and to explore the associations between these outcomes and disease activity.
Seventy-eight patients with AS (n = 30) and RA (n = 48) were included. Outcomes were assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form, the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia, the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, the Body Awareness Questionnaire, and the Beck Depression Inventory. Disease activity levels were determined using the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index for AS and the Disease Activity Score 28 score for RA.
AS patients were younger, had a higher proportion of men, and were more physically active than RA patients (p < 0.05). Both groups exhibited high levels of kinesiophobia but low levels of pain catastrophizing, similar body awareness and mild depression scores. Moderate correlations (r ≥ 0.5) were observed between kinesiophobia and depression, body awareness and pain catastrophizing and depression, and pain catastrophizing and disease activity in AS patients. In RA patients, moderate correlations (r ≥ 0.5) were found between kinesiophobia and pain catastrophizing.
Addressing physical activity, kinesiophobia, pain catastrophizing, body awareness, and depression is important in managing AS and RA patients. Notably, correlations among outcomes differed between groups, with more significant correlations in AS. Further studies are needed to explore these in greater detail.","['ankylosing spondylitis', 'body awareness', 'depression', 'kinesiophobia', 'pain catastrophizing', 'physical activity', 'rheumatoid arthritis']",Musculoskeletal care,10.1002/msc.1953,2024-10-01,"[{'lastname': 'Karaca', 'firstname': 'Nur Banu', 'initials': 'NB', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Arin-Bal', 'firstname': 'Gamze', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Sezer', 'firstname': 'Serdar', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rheumatology, Ankara Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Kelesoglu Dincer', 'firstname': 'Ayse Bahar', 'initials': 'AB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rheumatology, Dışkapı Yıldırım Beyazıt Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Kinikli', 'firstname': 'Gulay', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Rheumatology, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Boström', 'firstname': 'Carina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Division of Physiotherapy, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Kinikli', 'firstname': 'Gizem Irem', 'initials': 'GI', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey.'}]",39349418,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Musculoskeletal Care"""
39267253,Vasa et al.,The Impact of Depression on Adherence to Diabetes Self-Management Behaviors in Breast Cancer Survivors.,"Breast cancer survivors (BCS) have higher rates of depression which is associated with lower adherence to medications, diet, and physical activity. Managing diabetes (DM) requires adherence to several of these self-management behaviors (SMB), and BCS have an increased risk of DM. We investigated whether depressive symptoms were associated with adherence to DM SMB in a cohort of BCS.
BCS with DM were surveyed semiannually for 2 years. Depression was assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Adherence to DM medication, diet, and physical activity was self-reported using the Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS), Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities Assessment (SDSCA), and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), respectively. Using generalized linear equation modeling, the association of depressive symptoms with nonadherence to SMB was assessed, adjusting for age, race, marital status, education level, and beliefs about cancer and DM risk.
Among 244 BCS with DM, those who were nonadherent to medication, diet, and/or physical activity had higher depression scores (p < 0.01). In adjusted analyses, higher depression scores were independently associated with dietary (OR = 1.16, p < 0.001) and physical activity nonadherence (OR = 1.18, p < 0.001) but not with medication nonadherence. Concerns about medications was independently associated with medication nonadherence (OR = 1.17, p = 0.024).
Higher depression scores are associated with nonadherence to DM SMB in this cohort of BCS. These findings highlight the importance of addressing depressive symptoms in BCS to help improve adherence to DM medications, diet, and physical activity.","['breast cancer', 'cancer', 'depression', 'diabetes mellitus', 'oncology', 'psycho‐oncology', 'treatment adherence']",Psycho-oncology,10.1002/pon.9309,2024-09-15,"[{'lastname': 'Vasa', 'firstname': 'Devarshi', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of General Internal Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Guerra', 'firstname': 'Lauren', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of General Internal Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Goel', 'firstname': 'Mita S', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': 'Department of General Internal Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Harris', 'firstname': 'Yael Tobi', 'initials': 'YT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Hempstead, New York, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Jenny J', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of General Internal Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.'}]",39267253,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Psychooncology"""
39209276,Wu et al.,A longitudinal study of the mediator role of physical activity in the bidirectional relationships of cognitive function and specific dimensions of depressive symptoms.,"The bidirectional relationship between cognitive function and depressive symptoms has been extensively reported. However, the potential mechanisms are still not clear. We aim to longitudinally investigate whether physical activity mediates the bidirectional relationships between cognitive function and specific dimensions of depressive symptoms.
Data from 6,787 individuals aged ≥50 of 2014/15 (T1), 2016/17 (T2), and 2018/19 (T3) waves of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). Cognitive function was assessed by domains of memory, orientation in time, and executive function. Physical activity was measured with the intensity and frequency of participation. Specific dimensions of depressive symptoms were assessed by the 8-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, distinguishing between cognitive-affective and somatic symptoms. Cross-lagged panel models were used to investigate the mediating role of physical activity in the bidirectional relationships between cognitive function and two dimensions of depressive symptoms.
Poorer cognitive function was indirectly associated with worse cognitive-affective symptoms (indirect effect = -0.002, 95%CI: -0.004, -0.001) through lower physical activity levels. Poorer cognitive function was also indirectly associated with worse somatic symptoms (indirect effect = -0.003, 95%CI: -0.006, -0.002) through lower physical activity levels, and the reverse mediation was observed as well (indirect effect = -0.002, 95%CI: -0.004, -0.001).
There is no distinction between potential within-person and between-person effects.
Collaborative interventions of physical activity are beneficial in protecting cognitive function and mental health in older adults.","['Cognitive function', 'Cognitive-affective symptoms', 'Longitudinal', 'Mediation', 'Physical activity', 'Somatic symptoms']",Journal of affective disorders,10.1016/j.jad.2024.08.175,2024-09-01,"[{'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Yan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Public Health College, Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Kong', 'firstname': 'Xiangjie', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Public Health College, Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Feng', 'firstname': 'Wenjing', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Geriatrics, Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xing', 'firstname': 'Fangjie', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Public Health College, Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhu', 'firstname': 'Shuai', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Public Health College, Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Lv', 'firstname': 'Bosen', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Public Health College, Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Bixuan', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Public Health College, Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Shiru', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Public Health College, Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Sun', 'firstname': 'Yanping', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Yili', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Public Health College, Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.

39120630,Zhao et al.,Associations of 24-hour movement behaviors with depressive symptoms in rural-dwelling older adults: a compositional data analysis.,"We aimed to explore the association of sleep duration with depressive symptoms among rural-dwelling older adults in China, and to estimate the impact of substituting sleep with sedentary behavior (SB) and physical activity (PA) on the association with depressive symptoms.
This population-based cross-sectional study included 2001 rural-dwelling older adults (age ≥ 60 years, 59.2% female). Sleep duration was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. We used accelerometers to assess SB and PA, and the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale to assess depressive symptoms. Data were analyzed using restricted cubic splines, compositional logistic regression, and isotemporal substitution models.
Restricted cubic spline curves showed a U-shaped association between daily sleep duration and the likelihood of depressive symptoms (P-nonlinear < 0.001). Among older adults with sleep duration < 7 h/day, reallocating 60 min/day spent on SB and PA to sleep were associated with multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.78-0.84) and 0.79 (0.76-0.82), respectively, for depressive symptoms. Among older adults with sleep duration ≥ 7 h/day, reallocating 60 min/day spent in sleep to SB and PA, and reallocating 60 min/day spent on SB to PA were associated with multivariable-adjusted OR of 0.78 (0.74-0.84), 0.73 (0.69-0.78), and 0.94 (0.92-0.96), respectively, for depressive symptoms.
Our study reveals a U-shaped association of sleep duration with depressive symptoms in rural older adults and further shows that replacing SB and PA with sleep or vice versa is associated with reduced likelihoods of depressive symptoms depending on sleep duration.","['Accelerometer', 'Depressive symptoms', 'Physical activity', 'Population-based study', 'Sedentary behavior', 'Sleep duration']",Aging clinical and experimental research,"10.1007/s40520-024-02827-2

39096428,Yao et al.,The affective factors of depression symptoms in hypertensive patients and the protective effect of physical activity.,"To investigate the potential affective factors of depressive symptoms in patients with hypertension and explore the protective effects of physical activity.
211 hypertensive patients aged over 18 years were consecutively recruited. All patients completed a self-designed questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to assess the coexistence of depressive symptoms, and psychiatrists were invited to diagnose depression when necessary. Full-night polysomnography was performed to detect the sleep pattern. The association between sleep structure and depressive symptoms was tested by using logistic regression analysis, and contributing factors as well as the effect of physical activity were assessed among patients with and without depressive symptoms.
Of the 211 subjects, 33.6% of cases were coexistent with depressive symptoms. Female gender [OR (95%CI): 2.83 (1.44-5.57), P = 0.003) and the greater percentage of REM stage [OR (95%CI): 1.09 (1.01-1.18), P = 0.024] were the risk factors of depressive symptoms, while doing physical activity showed as the protective factor. Patients with REM stage ≥ 20% showed a higher score on HADS-D than those with REM stage < 20% [(4.9 ± 3.8) vs. (3.7 ± 3.1), P = 0.018]. Compared to individuals who never did physical activity, those who did physical activity 1-2 times per week and ≥ 3 times per week had a 52% and 62% risk reduction in depressive symptoms respectively. Patients who did physical activity had lower levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) compared to those who never did physical activity.
Female gender and a higher percentage of REM stage are risk factors for depressive symptoms in hypertension, while physical activity may benefit depressive symptoms by reducing serum levels of hs-CRP.","['C-reactive protein', 'Depression', 'Hypertension', 'Physical activity', 'Rapid eye movement']",Sleep & breathing = Schlaf & Atmung,"10.1007/s11325-024-03118-w

38876650,Campos et al.,"Sleep, psychological health, and physical activity level in patients with hypertension.","The aim of this study was to compare sleep, daytime sleepiness, and psychological health in physically active versus inactive patients with hypertension. A cross-sectional design included thirty-seven participants (ACTIVE, n = 15; INACTIVE, n = 22). Sleep was assessed by polysomnography, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and a one-week daily sleep diary. The sleepiness was assessed with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the psychological health was assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Profile of Mood States (POMS). Habitual physical activity was assessed with 7 day-step counts recorded by a pedometer and questionnaire. Significantly lower PSQI score (mean ± S.D.; 7.3 ± 3.4 vs 10.1 ± 3.6) and daytime sleepiness (8.7 ± 4.5 vs. 11.9 ± 4.4) were found in the physically active versus inactive participants, respectively. In addition, higher PSQI-total sleep time (6.9 ± 1.3 vs 5.6 ± 1.1) and vigor/activity (19.7 ± 3.9 vs 16.0 ± 3.9), and lower depressed mood on the POMS scale (8.2 ± 7.9 vs 13.8 ± 10.0) and lower POMS total mood disturbance (21.0 ± 27.0 vs 43.5 ± 32.5) were observed in the active participants compared with the inactive participants. Combining data across both groups, leisure time sport participation correlated negatively with PSQI (r = -0.35; p < 0.05) and BDI (r = -0.42; p < 0.05), and positively with POMS-vigor/activity (r = 0.43; p < 0.05).

Secondary analysis of a randomised clinical trial.
Acute Geriatric Unit of a tertiary hospital in Spain.
103 hospitalised older adults.
Individualised multicomponent exercise program (20-minute sessions twice a day for 3 consecutive days).
Among the 103 randomised patients included in the analysis (both arms included), 58.3% were male, and their mean age was 87.3 (4.5) years. According to the Lubben scale, 15.8% of patients were at risk of isolation, while 62.7% were in a situation of severe or moderate loneliness according to the De Jong Gierveld scale. In the non-isolated group, training showed a substantial positive impact on Geriatric Depression Scale (B = -1.25, 95% CI = -0.24 to -0.27). In the isolated group, all outcomes improved, but only the Quality of Life showed significant changes (B = 35, 95% CI = 4.96-35.8). The SPPB test (B = 1.62, 95% CI = 0.19-3.04) and Quality of Life, (B = 17.1, 95% CI = 1.84-32.3) showed a significant improvement in the non-loneliness exercise group while no differences were found in the loneliness group.
Despite the high prevalence of loneliness and social isolation, individualised exercise programs provide significant benefits to hospitalised patients, especially in quality of life.","['Acute care', 'Age-friendly environments', 'Disabilities', 'Emotion', 'Function']","The journal of nutrition, health & aging",10.1016/j.jnha.2024.100282,2024-06-05,"[{'lastname': 'Martínez-Velilla', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Navarrabiomed, Hospital Universitario de Navarra (HUN), Universidad Pública de Navarra (UPNA), IdiSNA, Pamplona, Spain; CIBER of Frailty and Healthy Aging (CIBERFES), Madrid, Spain; Facultad de Medicina, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.

38741292,Pinho et al.,"Associations between pain intensity, pain sensitivity, demographics, psychological factors, disability, physical activity, pain phenotype and COVID-19 history in low back pain: An observational study.","Knowledge of the factors affecting pain intensity and pain sensitivity can inform treatment targets and strategies aimed at personalizing the intervention, conceivably increasing its positive impact on patients. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the association between demographic factors (sex and age), body mass index (BMI), psychological factors (anxiety and depression, kinesiophobia and catastrophizing), self-reported physical activity, pain phenotype (symptoms of central sensitization, and nociceptive or neuropathic pain), history of COVID-19 and pain intensity and sensitivity in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain (LBP).
This was a cross-sectional secondary analysis with 83 participants with chronic non-specific LBP recruited from the community between August 2021 and April 2022. BMI, pain intensity (Visual Analog Scale), pain sensitivity at the lower back and at a distant point [pressure pain threshold], catastrophizing (Pain Catastrophizing Scale), kinesiophobia (Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), pain phenotype (Central Sensitization Inventory and PainDetect Questionnaire), physical activity (International Physical Activity Questionnaire), and disability (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire) were assessed. Multiple linear regression analyses with pain intensity and sensitivity as the dependent variables were used.

38658827,Baek et al.,"Effects of dual-task resistance exercise on cognition, mood, depression, functional fitness, and activities of daily living in older adults with cognitive impairment: a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial.","Regular exercise is emphasized for the improvement of functional capacity and independence of older adults. This study aimed to compare the effects of a dual-task resistance exercise program and resistance exercise on cognition, mood, depression, physical function, and activities of daily living (ADL) in older adults with cognitive impairment.
A total of 44 older adults participated in the study. Participants were randomly allocated to an experimental group (n = 22) performing a dual-task resistance exercise program for cognitive function improvement and a control group (n = 22) performing a resistance exercise program. Both groups performed the exercise for 40 min per session, three times a week, for 6 weeks (18 sessions). Cognition, mood, depression, functional fitness, and ADL were quantified before and after the intervention using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), profile of mood states (POMS), geriatric depression scale (GDS), senior fitness test (SFT), and Korean version of ADL, respectively.
There was a significant time and group interaction on the MMSE (p = 0.044). There were no significant time and group interactions in the POMS, GDS, SFT, or ADL. Cognitive function (p < 0.001), mood (p < 0.001), depression (p < 0.001), functional fitness (p < 0.001), and ADL (p < 0.001) significantly improved after dual-task resistance exercise, and cognitive function (p < 0.001), mood (p < 0.001), depression (p < 0.001), functional fitness (p < 0.001), and ADL (p < 0.001) significantly improved after resistance exercise.
Dual-task resistance exercise is more effective than resistance exercise in improving cognitive function in older adults with cognitive impairment. Both dual-task resistance exercise and resistance exercise improves mood, depression, functional fitness, and ADL after the intervention. We propose using dual-task resistance exercises for cognitive and physical health management in the older adults with cognitive impairment.

38641509,Gyasi et al.,Meeting the WHO Physical Activity Guidelines is Associated With Lower Odds of Depression in Older Adults: Potential Psychosomatic Mechanisms.,"Limited data exist on the association between physical activity (PA) and depression in older adults from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In this study, we examine the association between meeting the World Health Organization (WHO) PA guidelines and depression in adults aged ≥50 years in Ghana and investigate the psychosomatic factors explaining this association.
Cross-sectional data from the Aging, Health, Psychological Well-being, and Health-seeking Behavior Study in Ghana (2016-18) were analyzed. Depression was assessed with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-10). PA was assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF). Multivariable logistic regression and Hayes PROCESS macro with bootstrapping mediation analyses were performed to evaluate the hypothesized associations.
The study included 1201 individuals (mean [SD] age 66.1 [11.9] years; 63.3% women). The prevalence of meeting PA guidelines and depression was 36.7% and 29.5%, respectively. Meeting the WHO-recommended PA guidelines was associated with a 16% lower rate of developing depression even after adjusting for potential confounders (OR = 0.84, p <0.001). This association was much stronger among men and those aged 50-64 years. Loneliness, social isolation, sleep problems, functional limitations, and pain characteristics largely mediated the association of PA with depression.
PA was negatively associated with depression among older adults in Ghana, and psychosocial and physical factors partially explained the association. The promotion of PA in old age may aid in the prevention of depression, especially in men and those aged 50-64 years. Longitudinal data may confirm our findings.","['Depression', 'older people', 'pain', 'physical activity', 'psychosomatic factors', 'sleep']",The American journal of geriatric psychiatry : official journal of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry,10.1016/j.jagp.2024.04.001,2024-04-20,"[{'lastname': 'Gyasi', 'firstname': 'Razak M', 'initials': 'RM', 'affiliation': 'African Population and Health Research Center (RMG), Nairobi, Kenya; National Centre for Naturopathic Medicine, Faculty of Health (RMG), Southern Cross University, Lismore, New South Wales, Australia.

38600811,Zhang et al.,Physical Exercise Transforms the Topography and Increases the Invulnerability of the Symptom Network of Depression-Anxiety in the Elderly.,"Depression and anxiety often co-occur and have worse impacts on the elderly when experienced simultaneously. Although physical exercise may alleviate depression and anxiety, how it affects the specific symptoms is not fully understood.
A total of 8884 participants was selected from the 2018 CLHLS database. The 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD-10) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) were used to assess depression and anxiety, respectively. Participants were divided into the exercise and the nonexercise groups using propensity score matching to minimize the influence of confounding variables. Depression-anxiety symptom networks were constructed, and network indexes were computed for each group, based on various packages of R. By computing network connectivity, invulnerability simulation was used to investigate the role of physical exercise in network robustness.
Both groups had D3 (sad mood), A4 (trouble relaxing) and A2 (uncontrollably worry) as central symptoms. In the exercise group, A1 (nervousness), A3 (too much worry) and D1 (bothered by little things) were the strongest bridge nodes. In the nonexercise group, A1 (nervousness), D1 (bothered by little things) and A4 (trouble relaxing) played this role. Participation in physical exercise decreased the centrality of D9 (cannot get doing) but increased the centrality of A3 (too much worry). Furthermore, the exercise group had higher network invulnerability than the nonexercise group under random attack conditions.
Physical exercise affected core symptoms of depression-anxiety and the interactions of symptoms. Targeting central or bridge nodes may be an effective intervention for alleviating the comorbidity. Increased network invulnerability manifested the positive effects of physical exercise.","['depression–anxiety', 'invulnerability simulation', 'older adults', 'physical exercise', 'symptom network']",Clinical psychology & psychotherapy,10.1002/cpp.2971,2024-04-11,"[{'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Weixia', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': ""Department of Physical Education, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shanxi, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Kechuang', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': ""School of Mechanical Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shanxi, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Mengbi', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""School of Mechanical Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shanxi, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Si', 'firstname': 'Shubin', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""School of Mechanical Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shanxi, China.\nKey Laboratory of Industrial Engineering and Intelligent Manufacturing, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Xi'an, Shanxi, China.""}]",38600811,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Clin Psychol Psychother"""

A mild but significant inverse linear correlation was identified between the GDS-15 score and METs obtained in the IPAQ-S (rho=-0.213, p=0.007). Moderate to severe depressive symptomatology decreased with a higher level of physical activity: 4.3% low level, 3.3% moderate level, and no cases in those with vigorous activity; however, these differences were not significant (p=0.541, Kendall's Tau B test).

38511771,Meneguci et al.,"Isotemporal substitution analysis of time between sleep, sedentary behavior, and physical activity on depressive symptoms in older adults: a cross-sectional study.","Compared to young individuals, older adults participate more in sedentary behavior (SB) and less in physical activity (PA). These behaviors are associated with numerous adverse health factors.
The purpose of the study was to examine the hypothetical effects of substituting time spent sleeping, performing SB, and performing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) on depressive symptomatology in older adults.
An analytical cross-sectional study employing exploratory survey methods was conducted in the city of Alcobaça in the state of Bahia, Brazil.
The study included 473 older adults who answered a structured questionnaire during an interview. Exposure time to SB and PA level were assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, and depressive symptoms were analyzed using the short version of the Geriatric Depression Scale. An isotemporal replacement model was used to evaluate the effects of different SB sessions on depressive symptomatology.
An increase in the risk of depressive symptoms was observed when MVPA and sleep time were substituted for the same SB time at all times tested, with maximum values of 40% and 20%, respectively. Opposite substitution of MVPA and sleep time increments reduced the risk of depressive symptomatology by 28% and 17%, respectively.
The results of the present study indicate that replacing SB with the same amount of sleep or MVPA may reduce depressive symptoms. The longer the reallocation time, the greater are the benefits.",[],Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina,"10.1590/1516-3180.2023.0144.R2.04122023

38492665,de Lima et al.,Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior as Treatable Traits for Clinical Control in Moderate-to-Severe Asthma.,"Physical activity and sedentary behavior are treatable traits that may impact asthma control in distinct manners, but this impact remains poorly understood.
To evaluate the influence of physical activity and sedentary behavior on clinical control in adults with moderate-to-severe asthma.
This cross-sectional, multicentric study included 426 individuals with moderate-to-severe asthma. Assessments included physical activity and sedentary time (actigraphy), clinical asthma control (Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ]), quality of life (Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire), anxiety and depression symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), anthropometric data, and lung function. Participants were grouped according to physical activity levels and sedentary behavior.
Participants who walked ≥7500 steps/day presented better ACQ scores than those who walked <7500 steps/day (P < .05), independent of sedentary status. The percentage of patients with controlled asthma was higher in the active/sedentary (43.9%) and active/nonsedentary (43.8%) groups than in the inactive/sedentary (25.4%) and inactive/nonsedentary (23.9%) groups (P < .02). The likelihood of having uncontrolled asthma according to the treatable traits of physical inactivity (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 2.36 [1.55-3.59]), higher anxiety (2.26 [1.49-3.42]), and depression symptoms (1.95 [1.28-2.95]) was significant (P ≤ .002). Obesity and sedentary time were not associated with asthma control.
Our results show that ≥7500 steps/day is associated with better asthma control independent of sedentary time in adults with moderate-to-severe asthma. Physical inactivity, anxiety, and depression symptoms are associated with higher odds of uncontrolled asthma. These results suggest that interventions should mainly focus on increasing physical activity rather than reducing sedentary time.","['Asthma', 'Clinical control', 'Physical activity', 'Sedentary time']",The journal of allergy and clinical immunology.

38470426,Casals et al.,"Exploring the interplay of frailty, physical function, physical activity, nutritional status, and their association with quality of life and depressive symptoms in older adults with the frailty phenotype.","This study aimed to explore the interplay between frailty, physical function, physical activity, nutritional status, and their impact on the quality of life and depressive status in older adults with frailty.
A cross-sectional study involving 235 pre-frail/frail older adults residing in Spanish communities was conducted. Frailty was assessed using Fried's criteria, physical function was evaluated using the Short Physical Performance Battery, and physical activity levels were measured via wrist-worn accelerometers. Nutritional status was determined using the Mini-Nutritional Assessment alongside anthropometric measurements. Quality of life was gauged using the EuroQoL 5-Dimension 5-Level, while depressive status was assessed using the Yesavage 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale. Multivariate linear regression and logistic regression analyses were employed to elucidate the associations of these factors with quality of life and depression.
Our findings revealed significant correlations between various factors and quality of life. Notably, reported fatigue (β = -0.276, p = 0.002), performance in the 4-m gait test (β = -0.242, p = 0.001), the score on the short version of the Mini-Nutritional Assessment (β = 0.312, p = 0.002), and engagement in light physical activity (β = 0.180, p = 0.023) were all found to be associated with quality of life. In terms of depressive symptoms, the Mini-Nutritional Assessment score emerged as a protective factor (Odds ratio, OR: 0.812, p < 0.001), as did participation in moderate physical activity (OR: 0.988, p = 0.028). Conversely, fatigue (OR: 3.277, p = 0.003) and a slow gait speed (OR: 1.136, p = 0.045) were identified as risk factors for depressive symptoms.
This study underscores the detrimental association of fatigue and slow gait speed on both quality of life and depressive status among older adults with frailty. In contrast, engaging in physical activity and addressing malnutrition risk emerge as critical protective factors for enhancing quality of life and ameliorating depressive symptoms in this population.
This is a study that uses cross-sectional data from a trial registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT05610605).","['depressive symptoms', 'health-related quality of life', 'physical frailty', 'risk factors']",International journal of geriatric psychiatry,10.1002/gps.6078,2024-03-12,"[{'lastname': 'Casals', 'firstname': 'Cristina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'ExPhy Research Group, Department of Physical Education, Instituto de Investigación e Innovación Biomédica de Cádiz (INiBICA), Universidad de Cádiz, Puerto Real, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Corral-Pérez', 'firstname': 'Juan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'ExPhy Research Group, Department of Physical Education, Instituto de Investigación e Innovación Biomédica de Cádiz (INiBICA), Universidad de Cádiz, Puerto Real, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Ávila-Cabeza-de-Vaca', 'firstname': 'Laura', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'ExPhy Research Group, Department of Physical Education, Instituto de Investigación e Innovación Biomédica de Cádiz (INiBICA), Universidad de Cádiz, Puerto Real, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'González-Mariscal', 'firstname': 'Andrea', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'ExPhy Research Group, Department of Physical Education, Instituto de Investigación e Innovación Biomédica de Cádiz (INiBICA), Universidad de Cádiz, Puerto Real, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Carrión-Velasco', 'firstname': 'Yolanda', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'La Luz Clinical Management Unit, Malaga-Guadalhorce Health District, Malaga, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Rodríguez-Martínez', 'firstname': 'María Carmen', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiotherapy, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Malaga, Malaga, Spain.\nBiomedical Research Institute (IBIMA), Malaga, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Jiménez-Cebrián', 'firstname': 'Ana María', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Biomedical Research Institute (IBIMA), Malaga, Spain.\nDepartment Nursing and Podiatry, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Malaga, Málaga, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Vázquez-Sánchez', 'firstname': 'María Ángeles', 'initials': 'MÁ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nursing, Faculty of Health Sciences, PASOS Research Group, UMA REDIAS Network of Law and Artificial Intelligence Applied to Health and Biotechnology, University of Malaga, Malaga, Spain.'}]",38470426,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,DENIED: Wiley E Publisher says no to https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gps.6078/pdf
38279894,Loi et al.,Effects of physical activity on depressive symptoms in older caregivers: The IMPACCT randomized controlled trial.,"Physical activity (PA) can reduce depressive symptoms but has not been tested amongst depressed older caregivers and their care-recipients. The aim of this single-blind randomized controlled trial was to investigate the effect of a 6-month tailored PA program on depressive symptoms in older caregivers.
Caregivers were included if they had scores of ≥5 on the 15-item geriatric depression scale (GDS-15). Care-recipients could have any type of physical, mental or cognitive condition requiring support. The PA intervention group completed an individualized program based on the Otago-Plus Exercise Program. The primary outcome was improvement in depressive symptoms in caregivers measured at six and 12 months.
Two hundred and twelve participants (91 dyads and 30 caregivers only) were randomized using a 3:3:1 ratio to PA intervention, social-control, and usual-care control groups. There were no significant differences in depressive symptoms of the caregivers between the three groups at 6 months or 12 months. However, more than 50% of caregivers in all three groups no longer had a GDS-15 score ≥5 at 6 months. Further analysis revealed that caregivers in the PA group caring for someone with a standardised mini-mental state examination (SMMSE) score ≥24 had significantly less depressive symptoms than those caring for someone with a SMMSE score <24 compared with social-control (p < 0.02) and usual-care groups (p < 0.02).
A PA intervention may be beneficial for some caregivers in reducing symptoms of depression but may not be as beneficial to caregivers of people living with cognitive impairment.","['caregivers', 'depression', 'physical activity']",International journal of geriatric psychiatry,10.1002/gps.6058,2024-01-28,"[{'lastname': 'Loi', 'firstname': 'Samantha M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.\nNeuropsychiatry Centre, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Gaffy', 'firstname': 'Ellen', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'National Ageing Research Institute, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Malta', 'firstname': 'Sue', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Russell', 'firstname': 'Melissa A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Williams', 'firstname': 'Susan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'National Ageing Research Institute, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Ames', 'firstname': 'David', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.\nNational Ageing Research Institute, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.\nSt Georges Hospital, Kew, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Hill', 'firstname': 'Keith D', 'initials': 'KD', 'affiliation': 'Rehabilitation Ageing and Independent Living (RAIL) Research Centre, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Batchelor', 'firstname': 'Frances', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.\nNational Ageing Research Institute, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Cyarto', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth V', 'initials': 'EV', 'affiliation': 'Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Haines', 'firstname': 'Terence', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Rehabilitation Ageing and Independent Living (RAIL) Research Centre, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Lautenschlager', 'firstname': 'Nicola T', 'initials': 'NT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.\nRoyal Melbourne Hospital Mental Health Services, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Mackenzie', 'firstname': 'Lynette', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'The University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Moore', 'firstname': 'Kirsten J', 'initials': 'KJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.\nNational Ageing Research Institute, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Savvas', 'firstname': 'Steven M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.\nNational Ageing Research Institute, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Dow', 'firstname': 'Briony', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.\nNational Ageing Research Institute, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.\nDeakin University, Waurn Ponds, Victoria, Australia.'}]",38279894,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,DENIED: Wiley E Publisher says no to https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gps.6058/pdf
38186329,Bradson et al.,Physical Activity Moderates the Association Between Pain and Depressive Symptoms Among Persons with Multiple Sclerosis.,"The present study examined physical activity as a possible moderator in the relationship between pain and depressive symptoms among persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS).
Fifty-three PwMS completed a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery and psychosocial questionnaires. Pain was operationalized as a composite of measures from the Brief Pain Inventory. Metabolic equivalents (METs) of energy expended during self-reported vigorous activity (VA), moderate activity (MA), and walking, as well as global physical activity which combined the three, were derived from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form. Self-reported physical activity was measured using the Cognitive Health Questionnaire Exercise Scale. Regressions on depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory-Fast Screen) examining both conceptualizations of physical activity, pain, and their interactions were explored.
Regression analyses revealed that interactions between pain and each measure of global physical activity were significant (p = .01). Simple effects tests revealed that pain only influenced depressive symptoms in PwMS with low global physical activity METs (p < .001) and low overall self-reported physical activity (p < .001). The separate interactions between pain and METs during self-reported VA, MA, and walking on depressive symptoms were not significant.
We found that global physical activity moderated the relationship between pain and depressive symptoms in MS. Specifically, pain influenced depressive symptoms in PwMS who engaged in less overall physical activity. These results highlight the importance of screening PwMS for pain and suggest that behavioral interventions aimed at increasing overall lifestyle physical activity may be useful in improving depressive outcomes in PwMS with pain.","['Chronic pain', 'Depression', 'Exercise', 'Multiple sclerosis', 'Physical activity', 'Quality of life']",Archives of clinical neuropsychology : the official journal of the National Academy of Neuropsychologists,10.1093/arclin/acad097,2024-01-08,"[{'lastname': 'Bradson', 'firstname': 'Megan L', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Riegler', 'firstname': 'Kaitlin E', 'initials': 'KE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA.\nPsychology Service, VA Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, CT, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Thomas', 'firstname': 'Garrett A', 'initials': 'GA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Sakamoto', 'firstname': 'McKenna S', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Arnett', 'firstname': 'Peter A', 'initials': 'PA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA.'}]",38186329,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Arch Clin Neuropsychol"""
38182991,Li et al.,Physical activity and health-related quality of life in older adults: depression as a mediator.,"Physical activity(PA) is associated with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among older adults, and both are associated with mood, such as depression. However, the indirect effects of PA on HRQoL in older adults have not been clearly established. This study explained how different types and intensities of PA were associated with HRQoL while considering the effects of depression in older adults.
A cross-sectional study was conducted with 7,518 community-dwelling older adults aged 60 years and older. PA (leisure-time, household, and work-related), depression, and HRQoL were measured using the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE), the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-30), and the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), respectively. Information on age, gender, education, monthly income, activities of daily living, smoking, and alcohol drinking was also collected. Regression analysis was used to explore the relationship between PA, depression and HRQoL, and a mediation effect test process was used to verify the mediating mechanism of the depression on this relationship.
The study showed that after adjusting for a set of covariates, SF-36 Physical Component Summary (PCS) scores were negatively associated with depression (B = -2.046, 95% CI [2.584, -1.509]) and positively with PA (p < 0.001). Similarly, SF-36 Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores were negatively associated with depression (B = -11.657, 95% CI [-12.190, -11.124]). In mediation analyses, we found that depression partially mediated the relationship between different types and intensities PA and PCS (moderate leisure-time PA: B = 0.223, 95%CI [0.153,0.293], P < 0.001; vigorous leisure-time PA: B = 0.323, 95%CI [0.232,0.413], P < 0.001; moderate household PA: B = 0.092, 95%CI [0.045,0.139], P < 0.001; vigorous household PA: B = 0.137, 95%CI [0.085,0.190], P < 0.001; work-related PA: B = 0.193, 95%CI [0.658,0.190], P < 0.001) and MCS (moderate leisure-time PA: B = 1.243, 95%CI [1.008,1.479], P < 0.001; vigorous leisure-time PA: B = 1.800, 95%CI [1.585,2.015], P < 0.001; moderate household PA: B = 0.496, 95%CI [0.274,0.718], P < 0.001; vigorous household PA: B = 0.742, 95%CI [0.521,0.963], P < 0.001; work-related PA: B = 1.026, 95%CI [0.819,1.234], P < 0.001).
This study suggested that leisure-time, household, and work-related PA were negatively associated with depression, while positively affecting HRQoL in Chinese older adults. The relationships between different types and intensities of PA and HRQoL were mediated by depression. Interventions aimed at promoting purposeful exercise and different types of PA may have mental health benefits. It is recommended that geriatric health managers and healthcare planners prioritize interventions to help improve PA intensities, alleviate depressive symptoms to promote beneficial effects on HRQoL in older adults.","['Depression', 'Health-related quality of life', 'Mediator', 'Older adults']",BMC geriatrics,10.1186/s12877-023-04452-6,2024-01-06,"[{'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Xiuxiu', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.\nNHC Key Laboratory of Health Technology Assessment, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Pengfei', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.\nNHC Key Laboratory of Health Technology Assessment, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Jiang', 'firstname': 'Yihua', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Minhang District Mental Health Center of Shanghai, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Yinghua', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Laboratory Center in Shanghai, Shanghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Feng', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Minhang District Mental Health Center of Shanghai, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yan', 'firstname': 'Fei', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Ming', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Shanghai East Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai, China. liming1070202306@163.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Peng', 'firstname': 'Wenjia', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. pwenjia@126.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Ying', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. wangying1013@fudan.edu.cn.\nNHC Key Laboratory of Health Technology Assessment, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. wangying1013@fudan.edu.cn.'}]","38182991

38166293,Šilić et al.,Do depressive and anxiety symptoms influence the construct validity of Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12 scores?,"Walking dysfunction, depression, and anxiety are prevalent, burdensome, and interrelated outcomes in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). The 12-item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12) is a common patient-reported outcome (PRO) of walking dysfunction in research and practice involving MS, but the construct validity of its scores might be influenced by symptoms of depression and anxiety. This study examined if symptoms of depression and anxiety influenced the construct validity of MSWS-12 scores.
The sample included 189 participants with MS who completed the MSWS-12, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-Depression subscale [HADS-D] and HADS-Anxiety subscale [HADS-A]), 6-minute walk (6MW), and timed 25-foot walk (T25FW). We conducted bivariate correlation analysis to examine the associations between MSWS-12 scores and both the 6MW and T25FW, while controlling for HADS-D and HADS-A scores.
MSWS-12 scores were significantly correlated with the 6MW (
Our results strengthen the validity evidence for MSWS-12 scores as a PRO of walking dysfunction in MS, including among those with symptoms of depression and anxiety.

38113407,Silva et al.,The relationship between depressive symptoms and physical performance in postmenopausal women: a cross-sectional investigation.,"The relationship between depressive symptoms and declining physical performance in postmenopausal women has been extensively examined. However, various confounding factors can influence this association. This study aimed to investigate the link between depressive symptoms and physical performance in postmenopausal women while considering potential interfering factors.
In this cross-sectional study, 137 postmenopausal women were categorized into two groups based on the presence of depressive symptoms (n = 58; mean ± SD age, 60.12 ± 8.45 y) and absence of depressive symptoms (n = 79; mean ± SD age, 60.72 ± 7.45) using the Geriatric Depression Scale (short version) (GDS-15). Thoracic kyphosis angle was measured using the flexicurve method. Physical performance was assessed through various tests, including Timed Up and Go, Five Times Stand and Sit Test, 6-minute Walking Speed, 10-meter Usual Walking Speed, 10-meter Fast Walking Speed, and dynamometry. The study compared variables between the two groups and used linear regression models adjusted for dynamometry, kyphosis angle, age, antidepressant usage, sitting time, and fall history to evaluate the relationship between GDS-15 scores and physical performance.
Significant differences were observed in physical performance, body mass index, kyphosis angle, antidepressant usage, sitting time, and fall history between women with and without depressive symptoms. The GDS-15 showed a negative association with all walking speed tests (10-meter Usual Walking Speed, m/s; P < 0.001; B = -0.01; 10-meter Fast Walking Speed, m/s; P < 0.001; B = -0.02; 6-minute Walking Speed, m/s; P < 0.004; B = -0.01) and a positive association with the Five Times Stand and Sit Test ( P < 0.002; B = 0.21) and Timed Up and Go ( P < 0.001; B = 0.13) tests, regardless of grip strength, kyphosis angle, age, antidepressant use, sitting time, or fall history in postmenopausal women.
This study underscores the independent and substantial impact of depressive symptoms on the physical performance of postmenopausal women. These findings emphasize the importance of addressing both mental health and physical well-being when providing care and support for this demographic.",[],"Menopause (New York, N.Y.)","10.1097/GME.0000000000002300

38089035,Wang et al.,"Physical activity, physical frailty and depressive symptoms among Chinese male and female older adults: do different indicators make a difference?","Older adults become more inactive and frailer with aging. Physical status is closely linked to mental health, but it is unclear which physical indicator is more strongly associated with depressive symptoms in older adults. The present study aimed to compare relationships between self-reported physical activity, physical frailty (muscle mass, muscle strength, and gait ability) and depressive symptoms in community male and female older adults.
A total of 1,180 adults aged 60 years and older were recruited to participate in this study from a Chinese community receiving annual check-up service from September 2018 to May 2019. Physical activity was assessed by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). The Bio-electrical Impedance Analyzer was used to determine the muscle mass. As the indicators of muscle function, grip strength and gait ability were assessed by the dynamometer and Timed Up and Go Test (TUGT), respectively. The 15-item version of Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) was used to examine depressive symptoms. Demographic variables, health status and sleep quality were collected using questionnaire.
11.8% men and 11.9% women reported depressive symptoms. Logistic regression showed that depressive symptoms was associated with low grip strength (
There were gender differences in the relationship between physical activity, physical frailty, and depressive symptoms. Grip strength and gait ability may be a better indicator of frailty for predicting depressive symptoms in older men while physical activity may be useful in predicting depressive symptoms in older women.","['depressive symptoms', 'grip strength', 'older adults', 'physical activity', 'physical frailty']",Frontiers in public health,"10.3389/fpubh.2023.1280952

38044206,Lin et al.,Social network associated with depressed mood and sarcopenia among older adults in Taiwan.,"Social isolation is increasing in aging societies; however, its relationship with depressed mood and sarcopenia is not well studied. This study aims to examine the influence of social network on depressed mood and sarcopenia among community-dwelling older adults in Taiwan.
We collected data from a sample of 981 older adults residing in the community. These individuals received government-subsidized preventive healthcare services for adults at a district hospital in Taipei in 2021. The social network of the older adults who participated was assessed using the Lubben Social Network Scale, while depressed mood was assessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale. The definition of sarcopenia used in this study was based on the 2019 Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia.
According to this study, sarcopenia was present in approximately 15 % of older adults. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that older adults who had poor social network and did not meet the recommended 150 min of regular physical activity per week were more likely to have depressed mood. Additionally, older adults who were older, underweight, did not engage in regular physical activity, and had poor social network were more likely to have sarcopenia.
Poor social network was associated with increased risks of depressed mood and sarcopenia among older adults.","['Depressed mood', 'Older adult', 'Sarcopenia', 'Social network']",Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,10.1016/j.jfma.2023.11.004,2023-12-04,"[{'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Yu-Hung', 'initials': 'YH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Promotion and Health Education, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Community Medicine and Long-Term Care, National Taiwan University Hospital Bei-Hu Branch, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Han', 'firstname': 'Der-Sheng', 'initials': 'DS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, National Taiwan University Hospital Bei-Hu Branch, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Yi-Hsuan', 'initials': 'YH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Family Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Family Medicine, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chan', 'firstname': 'Ding-Cheng', 'initials': 'DC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Geriatrics and Gerontology and Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chang', 'firstname': 'Chia-Hsiu', 'initials': 'CH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nursing, Hungkuang University, Taichung, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Kuen-Cheh', 'initials': 'KC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Family Medicine, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chang', 'firstname': 'Fong-Ching', 'initials': 'FC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Promotion and Health Education, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan.

A prospective cohort study.
Patients with first-ever ischaemic stroke.
Mood was assessed 3- and 12-months post-stroke using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Sedentary behaviour and physical activity were measured using accelerometry 3 months post-stroke.
A total of 292 participants (116 (39.7%) females; mean age 71.7 (standard deviation 11.3) years) were included. At 12 months, 16.7% experienced depression and 19.5% anxiety, respectively. Adjusting for age and sex, regression analysis showed that comorbidity burden (β 0.26; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.02, 0.51; p = 0.038), stroke severity (β 0.22; 95% CI 0.10, 0.35; p = 0.001), functional disability (β 0.89, 95% CI 0.49, 1.30; p = 0.000), and global cognition (β-0.15; 95% CI -0.25, -0.05; p = 0.004) predicted depression.

37966990,"Kerkez, Erci",The Effect of Moving Meditation Exercise on Depression and Sleep Quality of the Elderly: A Randomized Controlled Study.,"The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of moving meditation exercise training on depression level and sleep quality in the elderly individuals. The present research was carried out between March 2021 and June 2022 as a randomized control group pretest-posttest design. The study sample consisted of 114 individuals 65 years of age and older who were registered to 2 family health centers in a province. The Introductory Information Form, Katz Activities of Daily Living Scale (Katz ADL), International Physical Activity Questionnaire, Geriatric Depression Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were used in the study. After the 6-week intervention, participants who were in the moving meditation exercise group had lower depression and had good Sleep Quality intensity scores than those in the control group. The average depression, subjective sleep quality, sleep disorder, and overall sleep quality significantly decreased over time in the moving meditation exercise group (P < .05). Moving meditation exercise may reduce the depression level of elderly individuals and improve sleep quality. These results show that moving meditation exercise can be a supportive method for traditional treatments. In consideration of the growing health economy, it may be recommended that nurses incorporate this exercise in their professional practice and compare long-term results with other complementary practices in the Turkish population.",[],Holistic nursing practice,10.1097/HNP.0000000000000627,2023-11-15,"[{'lastname': 'Kerkez', 'firstname': 'Müjde', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Services and Techniques, Vocational School of Health Services, Şırnak University, Şırnak, Turkey (Dr Kerkez); and Department of Public Health Nursing, Faculty of Nursing, Inonu University, Malatya, Turkey (Dr Erci).'}, {'lastname': 'Erci', 'firstname': 'Behice', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}]",37966990,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Holist Nurs Pract"""
37808987,Chen et al.,Is overall and timing-specific physical activity associated with depression in older adults?,"Regarding the circadian rhythm regulating an individual's response to external stimulation, it remains unclear whether older adults engaged in physical activity at different times of day may be differently related to depression symptoms. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the association between overall and timing-specific physical activity and depressive symptoms in older Taiwanese adults.
This cross-sectional study was conducted at a medical center in Taipei City, Taiwan, between September 2020 and December 2021. The participants were community-dwelling older adults aged ≥65 who could walk independently and were not at high risk of cognitive dysfunction. Physical activity was measured using a triaxial accelerometer (GT3X+, ActiGraph) and categorized into timing-specific periods (morning: 06:01-12:00; afternoon: 12:01-18:00; evening: 18:01-24:00) as well as overall physical activity, which included both light physical activity (LPA) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). A 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale was utilized to assess and measure depressive symptoms. Multivariate linear regression models were estimated for data analysis.
A total of 180 older adults (55.0% female; 80.5 ± 7.1 years old; 18.3% at risk of depression) were included. On average, the participants spent 237.3 (± 85.7) minutes in LPA per day and 12.8 (± 17.0) minutes in MVPA per day. The results showed that overall MVPA engagement was associated with lower depressive-symptom scores [
To prevent depression in older adults, it is advisable to accumulate a higher amount of MVPA throughout the entire day rather than engage in LPA. Further studies employing a prospective design are necessary to validate and strengthen our findings.","['accelerometer', 'circadian rhythm', 'depression', 'different proportions of physical activity', 'mental health']",Frontiers in public health,"10.3389/fpubh.2023.1241170

37592187,"Kostick, Zhu",Movement Behaviors and Mental Health of Catholic Priests in the Eastern United States.,"The purpose of this observational study was to examine (a) the proportion of Catholic priests in the United States that have anxiety/depression and meet the Canadian 24-Hour of Movement Guidelines, and (b) the association of meeting these guidelines with the likelihood of anxiety and depression. A sample of (arch)diocesan priests (n = 335) completed demographic and behavior survey, International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-SF), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results indicated that 21.1% of priests surveyed met all three movement guidelines (physical activity, sleep, and screentime) and 7.8% met none. Priests who reported excessive recreational screentime (≥ 3 h/day) were more likely to have anxiety (OR = 3.17) and depression (OR = 2.91), and who were physically inactive (< 150 min/week) were more likely to have depression (OR = 8.89). Data from this study addresses a gap in the literature regarding Catholic priests, movement behavior, and mental wellbeing.","['24-Hour Movement', 'Anxiety', 'Depression', 'Physical Activity', 'Screentime', 'Sleep']",Journal of religion and health,"10.1007/s10943-023-01894-5

37523359,Tiba et al.,T-RAC: Study protocol of a randomised clinical trial for assessing the acceptability and preliminary efficacy of adding an exergame-augmented dynamic imagery intervention to the behavioural activation treatment of depression.,"Improving the existent effective treatments of depression is a promising way to optimise the effects of psychological treatments. Here we examine the effects of adding a rehabilitation type of imagery based on exergames and dynamic simulations to a short behavioural activation treatment of depression. We investigate the acceptability and the efficacy of an exergame-augmented dynamic imagery intervention added to behavioural activation treatment and associated mechanisms of change.
In a two-arm pilot randomised controlled trial, the acceptability and preliminary efficacy of an exergame-augmented dynamic imagery intervention added to behavioural activation treatment for depressed individuals will be assessed. Participants (age 18-65) meeting criteria for depression are recruited by media and local announcements. 110 participants will be randomly allocated to behavioural activation plus imagery group or to standard behavioural activation group. The primary outcome is depressive symptom severity (Beck Depression Inventory II) and secondary outcomes are anhedonia, apathy and behavioural activation and avoidance. The outcomes are assessed at baseline, mid treatment, posttreatment and 3-month follow-up. Moderation and mediation analyses will be explored. An intention-to-treat approach with additional per-protocol analysis will be used for data analysis.",[],PloS one,"10.1371/journal.pone.0288910

37500950,Zare et al.,Evaluating the Impact of the Prime Time Sister Circles,"The Prime Time Sister Circles®, a randomized controlled trial (PTSC-RCT), assessed the impact of a community-based peer support program on hypertension management among African American women 40-75 years of age. While the PTSC-RCT was designed to evaluate changes in blood pressure control, subsequent sub-analyses revealed a high proportion of self-reported depressive symptoms in our sample. Accordingly, we conducted an ancillary investigation of the PTSC intervention on depression to ascertain its impact on reduced depressive symptoms in the study population.
Depressive symptoms were measured using an adapted version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale Revised (CES-D-10). We used unadjusted and adjusted fixed effect models. Data for this study came from the PTSC-RCT. We collected data between 2017 and 2018 in Washington, DC. We used a balanced analytical sample of 172 African American, English-speaking women between 40 to 75 years old with uncontrolled hypertension.
The intervention group participated in a 2-h, peer-based support group once a week for 13 weeks. A trained PTSC facilitator facilitated sessions with experts who delivered content on various topics, including psychosocial wellness (e.g., stress, depressive symptoms, anxiety management, and self-esteem), physical health (e.g., hypertension, inflammation, and heart disease), physical activity, and healthy nutrition.
Results from the fixed-effects models indicated that participants in the PTSC program exhibited a greater reduction in CES-D-10 score at three months (Coeff: -1.99, 95% CI: -3.49, -0.49) and at 15 months (Coeff: -2.38, 95% CI: -3.94, -0.83), as compared to those in the control group.
Evidence suggests that the Prime Time Sister Circles® intervention reduced depressive symptoms among African American women with low socioeconomic status and hypertension.

37487556,Lok et al.,Effect of physical activity program applied to patients with Alzheimer's disease on cognitive functions and depression level: a randomised controlled study.,"In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the effect of a physical activity program applied to Alzheimer's disease patients on cognitive functions and depression.
This study is a randomised controlled study designed in a pre-test post-test design. It was conducted with 72 patients in total, 36 of whom were interventions and 36 were controls, at the Alzheimer's Day Life Centre. In data collection, a personal information form prepared by the researchers, questioning the socio-demographic characteristics of individuals, Mini Mental Test and Cornell Dementia Depression Scale were used. In the analysis of the data, the homogeneity between the groups in terms of independent variables was evaluated by performing a Chi-square analysis. In the evaluation of cognitive functions and depression levels of the experimental and control groups, t-test was used in the dependent and independent groups. Statistical significance level was accepted as P < 0.05.
In the study, the cognitive functions of the experimental group, in which a 12-week physical activity program was applied, were higher than the control group and the difference was significant (P < 0.05). Similarly, the depression scale mean score of the experimental group was found to be better than the depression level of the individuals in the control group, and the difference was significant (P < 0.05).
The 12-week physical activity program applied to Alzheimer's disease patients improved cognitive functions and depression levels of individuals.","['Alzheimer', 'cognitive functions', 'depression', 'physical activity']",Psychogeriatrics : the official journal of the Japanese Psychogeriatric Society,10.1111/psyg.13010,2023-07-25,"[{'lastname': 'Lok', 'firstname': 'Neslihan', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatric Nursing, Selcuk University Faculty of Nursing, Konya, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Tosun', 'firstname': 'Alime Selçuk', 'initials': 'AS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health Nursing, Selcuk University Faculty of Nursing, Konya, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Lok', 'firstname': 'Sefa', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Coaching Education, Selcuk University Faculty of Sports Sciences, Konya, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Temel', 'firstname': 'Veysel', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Karamanoğlu Mehmetbey University Faculty of Sports Sciences, Karaman, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Aydın', 'firstname': 'Zekiye', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nursing, Selcuk University Health Sciences Institute, Konya, Turkey.'}]",37487556,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,DENIED: Wiley E Publisher says no to https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/psyg.13010/pdf
37470787,Donyaei et al.,Effect of combined aerobic-resistance training and subsequent detraining on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and depression in women with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A randomized controlled trial.,"In this study, we assessed the effects of a 12-week combined aerobic-resistance training and subsequent detraining on Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score and mediating role of BDNF and also investigated whether exercise-induced alterations are maintained following a short period of detraining in women with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
Thirty-four women with T2D were randomly assigned to experimental or control group (age: 60.6 ± 6.3, body mass index (BMI): 30.2 ± 1.3 kg/m
After 12 weeks of combined exercise training and 8 weeks of detraining, there was a significant difference in BDNF (0.08; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.07-0.10; p = 0.001), fasting blood glucose (FBG) (-45.41; CI = -50.83, -39.98; p = 0.001), insulin (-6.47; CI = -7.04, -5.9; p = 0.001), HOMA-IR (-3.76; CI = -4.07, -3.45; p = 0.001) and BDI score (-17.17; CI = -20.29, -14.05; p = 0.001) between the experimental and control group. Multiple mediation analysis indicated that BDNF seems to have a mediating role in exercise-induced improvement of depression (p = 0.04). After the detraining period, BDI score remained unchanged and it showed a significant increase compared to before the start of training (p = 0.001).
It may be concluded that exercise training improves depression that is likely to be explained by increased BDNF concentration in TD2. In spite of decreased BDNF concentration following an 8-week detraining, depression score was maintained.","['BDNF', 'depression', 'detraining', 'diabetes', 'exercise']",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,10.1111/dme.15188,2023-07-20,"[{'lastname': 'Donyaei', 'firstname': 'Adel', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Physical Education, Shahrood University of Technology, Shahrood, Semnan, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Kiani', 'firstname': 'Elina', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Physical Education, Shahrood University of Technology, Shahrood, Semnan, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Bahrololoum', 'firstname': 'Hassan', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Physical Education, Shahrood University of Technology, Shahrood, Semnan, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Moser', 'firstname': 'Othmar', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Division Exercise Physiology and Metabolism, Institute of Sport Science, University of Bayreuth, Bayreuth, Germany.\nDivision of Endocrinology and Diabetology, Interdisciplinary Metabolic Medicine Trials Unit, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.'}]",37470787,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,DENIED: Wiley E Publisher says no to https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/dme.15188/pdf
37428505,Laird et al.,Physical Activity Dose and Depression in a Cohort of Older Adults in The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing.,"Among older adults (aged ≥50 years), depression is associated with an increased risk of physical, social, and cognitive dysfunction. Regular moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) has been associated with lower odds of depression. However, the lowest dose for protection against depression and the extent to which exceeding this level conveys additional protection are unknown.
To evaluate different MVPA doses, depressive symptoms, and major depression status in a large cohort of older adults with and without chronic disease.
A longitudinal cohort study of the same 4016 individuals at each of 5 time points (ie, waves) from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing was conducted. Data were collected from October 2009 to December 2018, and data were analyzed from June 15 to August 8, 2022.
Continuous MVPA (metabolic equivalent of task [MET]-minutes per week [MET-min/wk]), 3 dose categories, and 5 dose categories measured with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire.
Depressive symptoms and major depression status were measured using the short form of the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale along with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview for diagnosis of a major depressive episode during the past 12 months. Multivariable negative random-effects binomial regression models, adjusted for relevant covariates, quantified associations across time.
Among the 4016 participants at each wave of the study (2205 women [54.9%]; mean [SD] age, 61.0 [8.1] years) during 10.0 years of follow-up, depression rates increased from a mean of 8.2% (95% CI, 7.4%-9.1%) to 12.2% (95% CI, 11.2%-13.2%). Bonferroni-corrected post hoc analysis indicated that participants performing 400 to less than 600 MET-min/wk had a 16% lower rate of depressive symptoms (adjusted incidence rate ratio [AIRR], 0.84; 95% CI, 0.81-0.86) and 43% lower odds of depression (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.57; 95% CI, 0.49-0.66) compared with 0 MET-min/wk. Those with chronic disease performing 600 to less than 1200 MET-min/wk had an 8% (AIRR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86-0.98) lower rate of depressive symptoms and 44% (AOR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.42-0.74) lower odds of depression compared with 0 MET-min/wk. Those without disease required more than 2400 MET-min/wk for similar protection for depressive symptoms (AIRR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.73-0.90).
In this cohort study of older adults, significant antidepressant benefits were noted for MVPA doses below current recommendations for overall health, although greater doses were associated with larger AIRR reductions. It may be useful for public health interventions to investigate the achievability of lower physical activity thresholds among older adults with and without chronic illness to reduce the risk of depression.",[],JAMA network open,"10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.22489

37280787,Christodoulou et al.,"Depression is associated with worse health-related quality of life, lower physical activity levels, and inadequate sleep quality in a Greek elderly population.","The present study is a cross-sectional study that aimed to investigate the potential associations between depression status, health-related quality of life, physical activity levels and sleep quality in a representative Greek elderly population. Three thousand four hundred five (3405) men and women over 65 years old from 14 different Greek regions were enrolled. Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was used to assess depression status, Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) was evaluated using Short Form Health Survey, physical activity levels were assessed via the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and sleep quality was evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). A high prevalence of depression and an increased incidence of poor quality of life, low physical activity levels and inadequate sleep quality among the elderly population were recorded. Depression status was independently associated with worse quality of life, poor physical activity, inadequate sleep quality, female gender, BMI and living alone after adjustment for potential confounding factors. Elderly age, low muscle mass, educational and financial status were also identified as indicators of depression; however, their impact on depression status was considerably attenuated after adjusting for confounding factors. In conclusion, depression was associated with worse health-related quality of life, poor physical activity and inadequate sleep quality in a Greek elderly population. Future randomized control trials should be performed to confirm the findings of this cross-sectional study.","['Depression', 'health-related quality of life', 'lifestyle', 'physical activity', 'public health', 'sleep quality']","Psychology, health & medicine",10.1080/13548506.2023.2221446,2023-06-07,"[{'lastname': 'Christodoulou', 'firstname': 'Efstratios', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Food Science and Nutrition, School of Environment, University of Aegean, Myrina, Lemnos, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Pavlidou', 'firstname': 'Eleni', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Food Science and Nutrition, School of Environment, University of Aegean, Myrina, Lemnos, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Mantzorou', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Food Science and Nutrition, School of Environment, University of Aegean, Myrina, Lemnos, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Koutelidakis', 'firstname': 'Antonios', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Food Science and Nutrition, School of Environment, University of Aegean, Myrina, Lemnos, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Vadikolias', 'firstname': 'Konstantinos', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, School of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Psara', 'firstname': 'Evmorfia', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Food Science and Nutrition, School of Environment, University of Aegean, Myrina, Lemnos, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Vorvolakos', 'firstname': 'Theofanis', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Geriatric Psychiatry, School of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupoli, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Antasouras', 'firstname': 'Georgios', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Food Science and Nutrition, School of Environment, University of Aegean, Myrina, Lemnos, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Serdari', 'firstname': 'Aspasia', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Child Psychiatry, School of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupoli, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Vasios', 'firstname': 'Georgios', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Food Science and Nutrition, School of Environment, University of Aegean, Myrina, Lemnos, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Giaginis', 'firstname': 'Constantinos', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Food Science and Nutrition, School of Environment, University of Aegean, Myrina, Lemnos, Greece.'}]",37280787,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Psychol Health Med"""
37228051,Leister et al.,Physical activity and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic among individuals with amputation.,"The isolating nature of various COVID-19 mandates may have reduced physical activity (PA) and increased mental health symptomology among individuals with amputation. However, an investigation of mental health across PA levels before and after the onset of COVID-19 among this group has not been conducted. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate group differences in depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptomology among individuals with amputation who reported being physically ""active,"" ""somewhat active,"" or ""inactivate"" before and during the pandemic. Individuals with an amputation at any level (n = 91; 51% female; age = 52.5±15.5) completed an online questionnaire to assess demographic information, PA levels, and mental health throughout the pandemic. Group differences in self-reported PA before and after COVID-19 onset were assessed by the PA Guidelines for Americans recommendations. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-5) scales were used to assess group differences in mental health status. Before and after the onset of COVID-19, 33% and 42.9% of respondents reported that they were inactive, respectively. 58.2% of respondents reported decreased PA since the pandemic's onset. Prior to the pandemic, active individuals reported lower CES-D (14.21 vs. 19.07; Cohen's d: -0.414), GAD-7 (3.82 vs. 5.47; Cohen's d: -0.359), and PCL-5 (15.92 vs. 21.03; Cohen's d: -0.319) scores compared to inactive individuals. After the onset of COVID-19, scores remained lower for active respondents CES-D (12.67 vs. 20.03; Cohen's d: 0.-669), GAD-7 (3.17 vs. 5.87; Cohen's d: -0.598), and PCL-5 (13.39 vs. 19.90; Cohen's d: -0.430). Individuals with amputation reported decreased PA after the onset of COVID-19. Individuals reporting that they were ""active"" exhibited improved depression and anxiety symptomology scores compared to those reporting that they were ""inactive.""",[],PloS one,"10.1371/journal.pone.0283762

36869290,"Oh, Song, Kim","Effects of 12-week Tai Chi program on physical function, depression, and quality of life among cognitively impaired older adults: a feasibility study.","Older adults with cognitive decline need physical activity for maintaining brain health and mitigating cognitive decline. Tai Chi is a safe and gentle aerobic exercise and has been recommended for people with various health conditions to improve their physical functioning, well-being, and quality of life (QoL). This study aimed to determine the feasibility of a 12-week program of Tai Chi for memory (TCM) among older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia; and to determine the pilot effects of TCM on physical functioning, depression, and health-related QoL.
A quasi-experimental design was used with two groups: MCI and dementia. The feasibility of the 12-week TCM program was assessed after it finished in terms of its acceptability, demand, implementation, practicality, adaptation, integration, expansion, and limited-efficacy testing. Other health-related outcomes, physical functioning, depression, and health-related QoL were measured before and after the TCM program. Outcome measures consist of a digital hand dynamometer for grip strength, the standard sit-and-reach test, the one-leg-standing balance test, timed up and go (TUG) test, the Korean version of the Geriatric Depression Scale, and the 12-item Short Form survey (SF-12). Paired and independent t-tests were used to compare the effects of TCM within and between groups.
The TCM program was completed by 41 participants with MCI (n = 21) or dementia (n = 20), and its accepted feasibility was assessed. After TCM, the MCI group exhibited significant enhancements in right-hand grip strength (t = - 2.13, p = .04) and physical-health-related QoL (t = - 2.27, p = .03). TUG scores improved in both groups (MCI, t = 3.96 p = .001; dementia, t = 2.54 p = .02). The adopted form of the TCM program was effectively and safely applied to those with various levels of cognitive impairment. The program was well accepted by the participants with a mean attendance rate of 87%. No adverse events were reported during the program.
TCM has the potential to improve physical functioning and QoL. Since there was no comparison group to control for confounding factors and low statistical power in the present study, further studies are warranted with a stronger design that includes longer follow-up periods. This protocol was retrospectively registered on Dec 1, 2022 (NCT05629650) at ClinicalTrials.gov.","['Dementia', 'Feasibility', 'Mild cognitive impairment', 'Quality of life', 'Tai Chi']",BMC geriatrics,"10.1186/s12877-023-03840-2

36833928,"Xiong, Wang, Ma",The Relationship between Physical Activity and Mental Depression in Older Adults during the Prevention and Control of COVID-19: A Mixed Model with Mediating and Moderating Effects.,"Several studies have found a strong relationship between physical activity and mental depression in older adults. Despite this, the social isolation, limited physical activity, and decreased social interactions caused by the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic control measures of ""home isolation and reduction unnecessary travel"" had a significant mental impact on older adults.
the goal of this study was to look into the complex effects of physical activity participation on mental health in older adults during COVID-19 prevention and control and the relationship between physical activity and mental depression in older adults through the mediating effect of self-efficacy and the moderating effect of social support.
The Physical Activity Rating Scale (PARS-3), the Center for Streaming Depression Scale (CES-D), the Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), and the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) were used to assess 974 older adults in five urban areas of Chengdu, China. The SPSS was used to analyze the collected data using mathematical statistics, linear regression analysis, and the AMOS to construct the research model.
The study's findings revealed that self-efficacy mediated the relationship between physical activity and mental depression in older adults (

Descriptive analytical research. Six hundred and ninety older people answered the instrument composed of sociodemographic questions, followed by questions from the WHOQOL-Old, Baecke-Old, WHOQOL-SRPB, Stress Perception Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory and Beck Depression Inventory.
The beneficial effect of PA on the elderly is evident in this sample with such a high QoL (73%) and such a high level of physical activity (84%), and even with an advanced level of education (75%) and high spirituality (99.6%). The influence of PA on the anxiety and stress cluster showed Pearson's chi-square = 9.9, DF = 4, 
In the elderly, PA has a significant relationship with anxiety, stress and QOL. In addition, the high level of QOL of the elderly in the sample demonstrates the capacity for PA, educational level and spirituality for personal satisfaction.","['anxiety', 'depression', 'older people', 'physical activity', 'quality of life', 'stress']",International journal of environmental research and public health,"10.3390/ijerph20021127

36649722,Osugi et al.,Interaction Between Sarcopenic Obesity and Nonlocomotive Physical Activity on the Risk of Depressive Symptoms in Community-Dwelling Older Adult Japanese Women.,"This study aimed to investigate the interaction between sarcopenic obesity and locomotive and nonlocomotive physical activity (PA) on the risk of depressive symptoms in community-dwelling older Japanese women. Participants were 143 community-dwelling older women aged 64-94 years. PA was measured using a three-axis accelerometer. Participants were classified according to two levels of total, locomotive, and nonlocomotive PA. Depressive symptoms were assessed by a self-administered survey consisting of the 15-item Japanese version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15-J). The interaction between sarcopenic obesity groups and total or locomotive PA did not affect GDS-15-J scores. However, the interaction between sarcopenic obesity groups and nonlocomotive PA significantly affected GDS-15-J scores (p < .05). Moreover, sarcopenic obesity in the low PA group had significantly higher GDS-15-J scores compared with sarcopenic obesity in the high PA group (p < .05). We concluded that sarcopenic obesity combined with low nonlocomotive PA may exacerbate depressive symptoms in older women.","['locomotive physical activity', 'older women', 'three-axis accelerometer']",Journal of aging and physical activity,10.1123/japa.2022-0142,2023-01-18,"[{'lastname': 'Osugi', 'firstname': 'Yu', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'College of Sport and Health Science, Ritsumeikan University, Shiga,Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Imai', 'firstname': 'Aiko', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation, Faculty of Health Sciences, Suzuka University of Medical Sciences, Mie,Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kurihara', 'firstname': 'Toshiyuki', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Letters, Kokushikan University, Setagaya, Tokyo,Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kishigami', 'firstname': 'Keiko', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'College of Sport and Health Science, Ritsumeikan University, Shiga,Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Higashida', 'firstname': 'Kazuhiko', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'College of Sport and Health Science, Ritsumeikan University, Shiga,Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Sanada', 'firstname': 'Kiyoshi', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'College of Sport and Health Science, Ritsumeikan University, Shiga,Japan.'}]",36649722,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""J Aging Phys Act"""
36640515,da Costa et al.,How much time of sedentary behavior is associated with depressive symptoms in community-dwelling older adults in southern Brazil?,"Identify sedentary behavior (SB) cut-off points to screen for depressive symptoms in older adults and verify the association between these conditions.
A cross-sectional survey of 308 community-dwelling older adults was conducted. The outcome was the presence of depressive symptoms (≥6 points on the Geriatric Depression Scale-15). The exposure was SB using the self-reported time on a weekday and weekend (International Physical Activity Questionnaire). The cut-off points for SB categorization were determined by the receiver operating characteristic curve and multivariate logistic regression to verify the association.
Older adults who spent ≥4.5 hours/day in SB (sensitivity = 48.8%; specificity = 67.8%) were 1.81 times more likely (95%CI: 1.03;3.15) to have depressive symptoms compared to those who stayed for shorter periods.
There was an association between SB and depressive symptoms; therefore, older adults must have SB <4.5 hours/day to reduce the chances of developing depressive symptoms.","['Aged', 'Depression', 'Public health', 'Sedentary behavior']","Geriatric nursing (New York, N.Y.)",10.1016/j.gerinurse.2022.12.014,2023-01-15,"[{'lastname': 'da Costa', 'firstname': 'Maria Eduarda', 'initials': 'ME', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Sciences, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Araranguá, Santa Catarina, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Cândido', 'firstname': 'Letícia Martins', 'initials': 'LM', 'affiliation': 'Postgraduate Program in Rehabilitation Sciences, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Araranguá, Santa Catarina, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'de Avelar', 'firstname': 'Núbia Carelli Pereira', 'initials': 'NCP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Sciences, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Araranguá, Santa Catarina, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Danielewicz', 'firstname': 'Ana Lúcia', 'initials': 'AL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Sciences, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Araranguá, Santa Catarina, Brazil; Postgraduate Program in Rehabilitation Sciences, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Araranguá, Santa Catarina, Brazil.

This cross-sectional study included 3,222 individuals ≥70 years of age (1,655 men; mean±SD age=79.2±5.6; cognitively unimpaired, N=2,723; mild cognitive impairment, N=499) from the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. PA (taken as a presumed predictor) in midlife (i.e., when participants were 50-65 years of age) and late life (i.e., the year prior to assessment) was assessed with a self-reported, validated questionnaire; PA intensity and frequency were used to calculate composite scores. NPS (taken as presumed outcomes) were assessed with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Regression analyses included midlife and late-life PA in each model, which were adjusted for age, sex, education, apolipoprotein E ɛ4 status, and medical comorbidity.
Higher late-life PA was associated with lower odds of having apathy (OR=0.89, 95% CI=0.84-0.93), appetite changes (OR=0.92, 95% CI=0.87-0.98), nighttime disturbances (OR=0.95, 95% CI=0.91-0.99), depression (OR=0.94, 95% CI=0.90-0.97), irritability (OR=0.93, 95% CI=0.89-0.97), clinical depression (OR=0.92, 95% CI=0.88-0.97), and clinical anxiety (OR=0.90, 95% CI=0.86-0.94), as well as lower BDI-II (β estimate=-0.042, 95% CI=-0.051 to -0.033) and BAI (β estimate=-0.030, 95% CI=-0.040 to -0.021) scores. Higher midlife PA was associated only with higher BDI-II scores (β estimate=0.011, 95% CI=0.004 to 0.019). Sex modified the associations between PA and NPS.
Late-life PA was associated with a lower likelihood of clinical depression or anxiety and subclinical NPS. These findings need to be confirmed in a cohort study.","['Anxiety', 'Depression', 'Geriatric Neuropsychiatry', 'Lifestyle', 'Neuropsychiatric Symptoms', 'Physical Activity']",The Journal of neuropsychiatry and clinical neurosciences,10.1176/appi.neuropsych.20220068,2022-12-06,"[{'lastname': 'Krell-Roesch', 'firstname': 'Janina', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Sports and Sports Science, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany (Krell-Roesch, Bezold, Trautwein, Barisch-Fritz, Jekauc, Woll);

36411413,"Kong, Hong, Kang",Relationship between physical activity and depressive symptoms in older Korean adults: moderation analysis of muscular strength.,"This population-based cross-sectional study examined the associations between physical activity (PA) and lower body muscle strength (LBMS) with late-life depression in a representative sample of older Korean adults aged 65 years and older.
The data used in the current study (n = 10,097/60% women) were extracted from the 2020 Korea Longitudinal Study on Aging, which is a nationwide population-based survey conducted in Korea. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Geriatric Depression Scale Short-Form. PA and LBMS were evaluated with a self-reported questionnaire and the 5 times sit-to-stand test, respectively. Covariates include age, gender, body mass index, education level, smoking status, alcohol intake, and comorbidity.
Insufficient PA had higher odds of depression (odds ratio [OR] = 1.201, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.035-1.393, p = 0.016), even after adjustments for all covariates, compared to sufficient PA. Poor LBMS had higher odds of depression (OR = 2.173, 95% CI = 1.821-2.593, p < 0.001), even after adjustments for all covariates, compared to good LBMS. Particularly, a significant moderation effect of LBMS on the relationship between PA and depressive symptoms was observed (β = 0.3514 and 95% CI = 0.1294 ~ 0.5733, p < 0.001). Individuals with poor LBMS had a greater odd of depression associated with physical inactivity compared to their counterparts with good LBMS.
The results of this study support the importance of promoting muscular strength through regular exercise as a preventive strategy against late-life depression in Korean adults.","['Late-life depression', 'Muscular fitness', 'Older adults', 'Physical activity']",BMC geriatrics,"10.1186/s12877-022-03610-6

36306566,Bizzozero-Peroni et al.,Proinflammatory dietary pattern and depression risk in older adults: Prospective analyses from the Seniors-ENRICA studies.,"Only a few studies have assessed the association between a proinflammatory diet and the risk of depression in older adults, and they have rendered weak results. The present study analysed the association between the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) and incident self-reported diagnosis or symptoms of depression in two cohorts of community-dwelling older adults in Spain.
We used data from the Seniors-ENRICA-I (SE-I) and Seniors-ENRICA-II (SE-II) cohorts. In both cohorts, the baseline DII was calculated from habitual food consumption estimated with a validated computer-based diet history. The incidence of both physician self-reported diagnosis of depression and mild-to-major depressive symptoms (≥3 on the 10-item Geriatric Depression Scale) was analysed. Logistic regression models were adjusted for the main potential confounders, such as sociodemographics, lifestyles, and comorbidities. The results of both cohorts were pooled using a random effects model.
Among the 1627 participants in SE-I (mean age 71.5 ± 5.5 y, 53.1% women) and the 1579 in SE-II (mean age 71.4 ± 4.2, 46.7% women), 86 (5.3%) and 140 (8.9%) incident cases of depression were identified after a mean 3.2-y and 2.3-y follow-up, respectively. The fully adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of incident depression for the highest (the highest proinflammatory diet) versus the lowest quartile of DII was 2.76 (1.25-6.08, p-for-trend = 0.005) in the SE-I, 1.90 (1.04-3.40, p-for-trend = 0.005) in the SE-II and 2.07 (1.01-3.13) in the pooled cohorts. The results were consistent across strata defined by sex, age, physical activity, loneliness/poor social network, and morbidity.
A proinflammatory dietary pattern is associated with depression risk in older adults. Future research should evaluate whether reducing the inflammatory component of diet leads to reduced depression symptoms in this population.","['Dietary inflammatory index', 'Health behaviour', 'Mental health', 'Older age']","Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",10.1016/j.clnu.2022.10.007,2022-10-29,"[{'lastname': 'Bizzozero-Peroni', 'firstname': 'Bruno', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Health and Social Research Center, Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, Cuenca, 16071, Spain; Instituto Superior de Educación Física, Universidad de La República, Rivera, 40000, Uruguay.'}, {'lastname': 'Ortolá', 'firstname': 'Rosario', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Calle Del Arzobispo Morcillo 4, 28029 Madrid, Spain; CIBER of Epidemiology and Public Health (CIBERESP), Avenida de Monforte de Lemos 3-5, Madrid, 28029, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Martínez-Vizcaíno', 'firstname': 'Vicente', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Health and Social Research Center, Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, Cuenca, 16071, Spain; Facultad de Ciencias de La Salud, Universidad Autónoma de Chile, Talca, 1101, Chile.'}, {'lastname': 'Rodríguez-Artalejo', 'firstname': 'Fernando', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Calle Del Arzobispo Morcillo 4, 28029 Madrid, Spain; CIBER of Epidemiology and Public Health (CIBERESP), Avenida de Monforte de Lemos 3-5, Madrid, 28029, Spain; IMDEA Food Institute, CEI UAM+CSIC, Carretera de Canto Blanco 8, Madrid, 28049, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Fernández-Rodríguez', 'firstname': 'Rubén', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Health and Social Research Center, Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, Cuenca, 16071, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Banegas', 'firstname': 'José R', 'initials': 'JR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Calle Del Arzobispo Morcillo 4, 28029 Madrid, Spain; CIBER of Epidemiology and Public Health (CIBERESP), Avenida de Monforte de Lemos 3-5, Madrid, 28029, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Lopez-Garcia', 'firstname': 'Esther', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Calle Del Arzobispo Morcillo 4, 28029 Madrid, Spain; CIBER of Epidemiology and Public Health (CIBERESP), Avenida de Monforte de Lemos 3-5, Madrid, 28029, Spain; IMDEA Food Institute, CEI UAM+CSIC, Carretera de Canto Blanco 8, Madrid, 28049, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Mesas', 'firstname': 'Arthur Eumann', 'initials': 'AE', 'affiliation': 'Health and Social Research Center, Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, Cuenca, 16071, Spain; Postgraduate Program in Public Health, Universidade Estadual de Londrina, Londrina, Paraná, 86057-970, Brazil.

36268987,"Sergio, Siedlecki",Which variables moderate the relationship between depressive symptoms and global neurocognition across adulthood?,"The current study examined moderators of the relationship between depressive symptoms and global neurocognition in a large non-clinical community-dwelling sample spanning adulthood. Participants comprised 5,430 individuals between the ages of 18-99 years drawn from the Virginia Cognitive Aging Project. Depressive symptoms were measured via the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale and neurocognition was operationalized as a composite variable comprising episodic memory, spatial visualization, processing speed, and reasoning tasks. Moderator variables included physical activity, cognitive activity, education, emotional stability, and openness. Hierarchical regressions were used to examine the influence of depressive symptoms and the moderators on neurocognition. Depressive symptoms significantly predicted neurocognition. Cognitive activity, years of education, and emotional stability moderated the depression-neurocognition relationship by buffering the impact of depressive symptoms on neurocognition. Cognitive activity engagement and level of education may function as a protective influence on those with higher levels of depressive symptoms, while emotional stability may be protective for individuals with lower levels of depressive symptoms. No differences in moderation were found across three age groups representing younger, middle, and older adults. Post-hoc analyses showed years of education and openness as moderators in a subsample excluding individuals with potentially clinically meaningful levels of depressive symptoms.","['Cognitive activity', 'Virginia cognitive aging project', 'depressive symptoms', 'education', 'neurocognition', 'personality', 'physical activity']","Neuropsychology, development, and cognition.

36194451,Zhang et al.,Associations Between Depression Symptom Severity and Daily-Life Gait Characteristics Derived From Long-Term Acceleration Signals in Real-World Settings: Retrospective Analysis.,"Gait is an essential manifestation of depression. However, the gait characteristics of daily walking and their relationships with depression have yet to be fully explored.
The aim of this study was to explore associations between depression symptom severity and daily-life gait characteristics derived from acceleration signals in real-world settings.
We used two ambulatory data sets (N=71 and N=215) with acceleration signals collected by wearable devices and mobile phones, respectively. We extracted 12 daily-life gait features to describe the distribution and variance of gait cadence and force over a long-term period. Spearman coefficients and linear mixed-effects models were used to explore the associations between daily-life gait features and depression symptom severity measured by the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) and 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) self-reported questionnaires. The likelihood-ratio (LR) test was used to test whether daily-life gait features could provide additional information relative to the laboratory gait features.
Higher depression symptom severity was significantly associated with lower gait cadence of high-performance walking (segments with faster walking speed) over a long-term period in both data sets. The linear regression model with long-term daily-life gait features (R
This study indicated that the significant links between daily-life walking characteristics and depression symptom severity could be captured by both wearable devices and mobile phones. The daily-life gait patterns could provide additional information for predicting depression symptom severity relative to laboratory walking. These findings may contribute to developing clinical tools to remotely monitor mental health in real-world settings.","['acceleration signals', 'depression', 'gait', 'mHealth', 'mental health', 'mobile health', 'mobile phones', 'monitoring', 'wearable devices']",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"10.2196/40667

35941206,Chen et al.,The association between street connectivity and depression among older Japanese adults: the JAGES longitudinal study.,"Mental health is important in older age; neighborhood environment is considered a protective factor of depression. Research has established that a critical indicator of neighborhood environment, street connectivity, is related to older people's health. However, little is known about the relationship between street connectivity and depression. We examined the relationship between street connectivity and depression among older people. Using Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study 2013-2016, the target population comprised 24,141 independent older people without depression (Geriatric Depression Scale scores below 5) in 2013. The outcome variable was depression in 2016; the explanatory variable was street connectivity calculated by intersection density and space syntax within 800 m around the subject's neighborhood in 2013. We used logistic regression analysis to calculate the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for the new occurrence of depression among participants in 2016. This analysis demonstrated incidence of new depression after 3 years that is 17% and 14% lower among participations living in high-intersection density and high-street-connectivity areas, respectively, than those living in low-intersection density and low-street-connectivity areas. The association held after adjusting for physical activities and social interaction. Given the established connection between street connectivity and mental health, the findings can contribute to healthy urban planning.",[],Scientific reports,"10.1038/s41598-022-17650-w

35579606,Yu et al.,Comparison of moderate and vigorous walking exercise on reducing depression in middle-aged and older adults: A pilot randomized controlled trial.,"The optimal intensity of physical activity for alleviating depression in middle-aged and older adults remains unclear. The World Health Organization (WHO) physical activity guidelines recommend adults and older adults to accumulate at least 150-300 minutes of moderate or 75-150 minutes of vigorous aerobic-type physical activity weekly or an equivalent combination of both for health benefits including reduced risk of depression. This parallel, assessor-blinded, pilot randomized controlled trial preliminarily compared the effectiveness of the minimal volume of aerobic-type physical activity at different intensities as recommended by WHO (150 minutes of moderate walking exercise and 75 minutes of vigorous walking exercise weekly) on alleviating depression in middle-aged and older adults. Thirty-five participants were randomized to the control group (CON), moderate walking exercise group (MOD), or vigorous walking exercise group (VIG). The exercise frequency was three times a week and the intervention duration was 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the severity of depression assessed by Beck Depression Inventory. Secondary outcomes included severity of anxiety, sleep quality, quality of life, and cardiorespiratory fitness.

Three years of data from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study were used, comprising a total of 33,746 men and 36,799 women age ≥65 yr. To determine the relationship between 20 types of sports and exercise group participation in 2016 (baseline) and changes in depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15)), self-rated health (4-point scale), subjective well-being (11-point scale), and frequency of laughter (days per month) from 2016 to 2019, we performed linear regression analyses with conducting a multivariate adjustment for potential confounders using an inverse probability weighting method.
The mean changes over 3 yr were +0.32 and +0.28 in GDS-15, -0.06 and -0.05 in self-rated health, -0.08 and -0.06 in subjective well-being, and -1.21 and -1.19 in frequency of laughter, in men and women, respectively. Men playing golf in a group were more likely to suppress an increase in the GDS-15 ( B = -0.11, 95% confidence interval, -0.18 to -0.05) and decreases in self-rated health (0.04, 0.02 to 0.06), subjective well-being (0.07, 0.02 to 0.12), and frequency of laughter (0.45, 0.11 to 0.80). Women participating in walking, weight exercises, and hiking groups were more likely to prevent an increase in the GDS-15 (-0.12, -0.19 to -0.04; -0.09, -0.18 to -0.01; and -0.16, -0.30 to -0.03, respectively) and decreases in self-rated health (0.03, 0.01 to 0.05; 0.03, 0.01 to 0.06; and 0.08, 0.04 to 0.12, respectively).

This study aimed to examine the effects of yoga and combined aerobic and strength training (A+ST) on quality of life and related parameters such as sleep, fatigue, emotional state, sexual function, and cognitive status in women with PA.
Ten women with PA were included in this randomized crossover study. Group 1 (n = 5, mean age: 52 ± 13.5 years) received A+ST for the first 6 weeks, a 2-week washout period, and yoga for the second 6 weeks. Group 2 (n = 5, mean age: 41.8 ± 14 years) received the yoga program first, followed by the A+ST program.
Participants were assessed using the following tools before and after each exercise intervention: Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-Br) (quality of life), Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index, Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MOCA).
FACT-Br scores were higher after the yoga program, HADS anxiety score was lower after the A+ST program, and MOCA scores increased after both exercise programs (P < 0.05). FSS score decreased after both exercise programs, but not significantly. In addition, nonsignificant decreases in HADS anxiety and depression scores and increased FSFI scores were observed after the yoga program.
A+ST and yoga have positive effects on the quality of life in PA. We recommend yoga and A+ST as a supportive therapy for this population that may face comorbidities after surgical and medical treatment.

35264535,Kodama et al.,[Factors influencing changes in daily life due to the state of emergency among older adults living in Akita Prefecture].,"The present study is assessed the effects of COVID-19 on the mental and physical function after the declaration of an emergency situation, which included the request that residents refrain from going out, in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19 infection. The investigation was conducted from 2019 to 2020. Our samples consisted of 506 older adults (332 people in 2019 and 174 people in 2020), whose physical, cognitive, depression, and independence in daily and social activities were measured annually. Furthermore, a questionnaire survey (COVID-19 questionnaire) on the impact of the spread of COVID-19 infection on respondents' daily lives (reduction in social interaction, going out, exercise, and sleep time) was conducted among participants in 2020. According to a statistical analysis, the UWS (Usual Walking Speed) was significantly faster in 2020 than it had been in 2019 (p<0.000). However, no significant differences were found in other items. A correlation analysis, revealed a significant association between the reduction in sleep time and GDS-15 (Geriatric Depression Scale) score (r=0.200, p=0.019) and between the COVID-19 questionnaire total score and body mass index (r=0.282, p=0.001).These results suggest that the decline in the physical and mental function might not have been evident in older adults in Akita Prefecture, where the number of infected people is small, although a more detailed long-term follow-up is needed. Even in such areas, there might be a significant relationship between depression and sleep or between changes in daily life due to self-imposed restraint and obesity as an effect of self-imposed restraint among older adults.","['COVID-19', 'Depression', 'Obesity', 'Older adults living', 'State of emergency']",Nihon Ronen Igakkai zasshi.

Data of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey in 2018 was used in our study and a total of 17898 participants were included. SRH status was graded as ""very good, good, average, bad, very bad."" Participants who answered ""very good"" and ""good"" were regarded as self-rated good health and who answered ""average,"" ""bad"" and ""very bad"" were regarded as self-rated poor health. Odds ratio and 95% confidence interval of Logistics regression were calculated to evaluate the correlation between SRH and chronic diseases, demographic characteristics and lifestyle of middle-aged and elderly participants.A total of 4476 (25.01%) participants reported they had good health, and 13422 (74.99%) reported they had poor health. 9975 participants self-rated they had no chronic disease (55.73%), and 7923 (44.27%) participants self-rated they suffered from one and above chronic diseases. The prevalence of chronic diseases showed significant odds ratio and trend with SRH poor rate of participants. The more kinds of chronic diseases they suffered from, the poorer SRH was reported in middle-aged and elderly participants. Except for the chronic diseases, participants with higher age, living in rural, with high Center for Epidemiological Survey-Depression Scale score of depression and fewer time of physical activities also correlated with higher SRH (poor) rate.The SRH (good) rate was very low in middle-aged and elderly, participants who accompanied with more kinds of chronic diseases, fewer physical activities, higher age and living in the rural had a worse health status.

34674657,Liang et al.,"Patterns of physical activity and their relationship with depression among community-dwelling older adults in Shanghai, China: a latent class approach.","Few studies have explored patterns of physical activity (PA) and examined their relationship with depression among community-dwelling older adults. We aimed to identify the patterns of PA through a person-centered analytical approach and examine the association between quantity and patterns of PA, and depression among community-dwelling older adults.
We conducted a cross-sectional survey study in the Minhang district, Shanghai, China, in August 2019, and used a self-administered questionnaire to collect data through home visits. The total sample included 2525 older adults. This study used the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) to assess the quantity of PA in older adults. Depression was evaluated with the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify subpopulations by shared item response patterns. Logistic regressions were performed to estimate the relationship between PASE score, patterns of PA, and depression. An exploratory analysis of joint levels and patterns of PA effects on depression was based on sample subgroups with combinations of levels and patterns of PA. Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio for combined subgroups.
Four latent classes were identified: ""domestic types,"" ""athletic types,"" ""gardening/caring types,"" and ""walkers."" PASE scores and patterns of PA both were associated with depression. Older adults who were the most active (PASE quartile: 75-100%) and the athletic types had the strongest significant association with depression (OR = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.06-0.65), followed by those who were the most active (PASE quartile: 75-100%) and the walkers (OR = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.14-0.57) when compared with older adults with the least activity (PASE quartile: 0-25%) and domestic types.
This study suggests both the quantity and patterns of physical activity are associated with depressive symptoms among community-dwelling older adults. Population-level intervention should encourage community-dwelling older adults to increase their quantity of PA to reduce the risk of depression. Athletics and walkers are recommended. To develop individual-level tailored interventions, more attention should be paid to older adults who are highly engaged in gardening/caring for others.","['Depression', 'Latent class analysis, LCA', 'Older adults', 'Patterns', 'Physical activity']",BMC geriatrics,"10.1186/s12877-021-02537-8

34405224,Kirk et al.,Depressive symptom heterogeneity among older adults after hip fracture.,"to evaluate patterns of depressive symptoms after hip fracture and examine their impact on functional recovery.
participants (n = 304) included older adults from the Baltimore Hip Studies 7th cohort who experienced a hip fracture. Depressive symptoms were measured at baseline or 2-, 6- or 12-month post-hip fracture using the 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale. Gait speed was measured after hip fracture at 2-, 6- or 12-month follow-up. Latent class analysis was used to identify individuals with similar patterns of depressive symptoms after hip fracture. Item response probabilities characterised symptom profiles, and posterior probability estimates were used to assign participants to a baseline depressive symptom subtype. Weighted estimated equations compared post-fracture gait speed between baseline symptomatic and asymptomatic groups.
four patterns of depressive symptoms were identified: asymptomatic (50.8%), somatic (28.6%), melancholic (11.4%) and anhedonic (9.2%). The somatic subtype was characterised by difficultly concentrating and reduced energy and movement, whereas anhedonic symptoms were associated with the inability to experience pleasure. Melancholic symptoms corresponded to anhedonia, decreased physical activity and other psychological and somatic complaints. Compared with the asymptomatic group, somatic symptoms were consistently associated with slower gait speed, -0.03 metres per second (m/s) and between-group differences for melancholic symptomology were as large as -0.05 m/s, but the associations were not statistically significant.
findings demonstrate unique depressive symptom subtypes in older adults after hip fracture and provide confirmatory evidence of unique clinical phenotypes; however, their impact on functional recovery after hip fracture remains unclear.","['depression', 'heterogeneity', 'hip fracture', 'older people', 'physical performance']",Age and ageing,10.1093/ageing/afab168,2021-08-19,"[{'lastname': 'Kirk', 'firstname': 'Jennifer M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Magaziner', 'firstname': 'Jay', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Shardell', 'firstname': 'Michelle D', 'initials': 'MD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ryan', 'firstname': 'Alice S', 'initials': 'AS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.\nGeriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, VA Maryland Healthcare System, Baltimore, MD, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Gruber-Baldini', 'firstname': 'Ann L', 'initials': 'AL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Orwig', 'firstname': 'Denise', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hochberg', 'firstname': 'Marc C', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.\nMedical Clinical Care Center, VA Maryland Healthcare System, Baltimore, MD, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Rathbun', 'firstname': 'Alan M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.'}]","34405224

34397901,Zhong et al.,Impacts of the perioperative fast track surgery concept on the physical and psychological rehabilitation of total hip arthroplasty: A prospective cohort study of 348 patients.,"Studies have shown that rapid rehabilitation surgery has a positive effect on recovery after major orthopedic surgery. However, very few studies have examined the impact of fast track surgery on physical and psychological rehabilitation in patients who have undergone total hip replacement.This study aimed to investigate the value of the rapid rehabilitation surgical model for patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty during the perioperative period.We conducted a prospective cohort study that included patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty at our hospital from January 2015 to December 2018. We divided the patients into 2 groups - the rapid rehabilitation group and the conventional rehabilitation group - and compared their length of hospital stay, time to off-bed activity, pain score, Self-Rating Anxiety Scale scores, Self-Rating Depression Scale scores, complication rate, and rate of satisfaction during hospitalization.A total of 348 patients were included in the study. Of these, 180 received rapid rehabilitation nursing and 168 patients received conventional nursing. Compared with the patients in the conventional rehabilitation group, those in the rapid rehabilitation group had shorter hospital stays (11.5 ± 1.2 day vs 15.5 ± 2.3 day, P = .021), resumed off-bed activities sooner (20.5 ± 3.4 hours vs 61.8 ± 4.7 hours, P = .001, had less postoperative pain (4.0 ± 1.2 vs 6.5 ± 1.1, P < .001), and lower anxiety and depression scores (anxiety score: 24.4 ± 2.1 vs 47.9 ± 2.9; depression score: 25.8 ± 1.8 vs 43.7 ± 1.7, P < .001).The application of rapid rehabilitation surgery in total hip arthroplasty can accelerate patients' postoperative recovery, relieve anxiety and depression, and increase the patient's satisfaction with the treatment.",[],Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000026869,2021-08-17,"[{'lastname': 'Zhong', 'firstname': 'Meiyan', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedics, Minzu Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Nanning, Guangxi, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Dehuai', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedics, Minzu Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Nanning, Guangxi, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Tang', 'firstname': 'Haijun', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedics, Minzu Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Nanning, Guangxi, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zheng', 'firstname': 'Yadong', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedics, Minzu Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Nanning, Guangxi, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Bai', 'firstname': 'Yu', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedics, Minzu Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Nanning, Guangxi, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Liang', 'firstname': 'Qinghua', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedics, Minzu Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Nanning, Guangxi, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Xining', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Minzu Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Nanning, Guangxi, China.'}]","34397901

34294608,Liang et al.,Sport and Recreational Physical Activities Attenuate the Predictive Association of Multimorbidity With Increased Geriatric Depressive Symptoms: A 14-Year Follow-Up Study of Community-Dwelling Older Adults.,"Multimorbidity is associated with increased depression risks. Little research examines how physical exercise moderates this association. From an existing cohort of community-dwelling older adults in Hong Kong recruited in 2001-2003, the authors included participants who were successfully interviewed after 14 years (2015-2017). Geriatric depressive symptoms were used as the primary outcome and measured by the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale, while multimorbidity was operationalized using a list of 19 conditions. Subscores of the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly measuring light, moderate, and strenuous sport/recreational activities were included as moderators. In total, 1,056 participants were included, of whom 50.7% were multimorbid. Multimorbidity was associated with 12% more geriatric depressive symptoms, but strenuous physical activities were associated with a smaller risk elevation only among multimorbid patients (adjusted relative risk = 0.99, 95% confidence interval [0.98, 0.99]; p = .001). In conclusion, strenuous sport and recreational activities may attenuate the association between multimorbidity and geriatric depressive symptoms.","['comorbidity', 'exercise', 'mental health']",Journal of aging and physical activity,10.1123/japa.2021-0070,2021-07-24,"[{'lastname': 'Liang', 'firstname': 'Yonglin', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lai', 'firstname': 'Francisco T T', 'initials': 'FTT', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kwan', 'firstname': 'Joyce L Y', 'initials': 'JLY', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Chan', 'firstname': 'Wai', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Yeoh', 'firstname': 'Eng-Kiong', 'initials': 'EK', 'affiliation': None}]",34294608,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""J Aging Phys Act"""

This will be a multicentre, randomized, two-group clinical trial with a 1-year follow-up. Participants will be 150 primary care patients aged >64 years allocated equally to a control group and an intervention group. Inclusion criteria are Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) score ≥14 and/or General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale score ≥10 and/or Duke-UNC-11 scale score ≥32. The intervention group will participate in a 4-month group PA program. The program will comprise two walks per week and a monthly visit to a sociocultural facility.
Measured outcomes are clinical remission of depression (BDI-II score <14) and anxiety (GAD-7 scale score <10), improved social support (reduction in DUKE-UNC-11 score), improved quality of life and/or response to the intervention at 4 and 12 months post-intervention. Intervention satisfaction and adherence and post-intervention links with sociocultural organizations will also be assessed.
The findings could encourage the provision of activity-based community interventions for older individuals.","['Physical activity', 'anxiety', 'depression', 'elderly', 'loneliness', 'primary care', 'social problem']",The Journal of international medical research,"10.1177/03000605211016735

This study used cross-sectional data from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study, a nationwide mail survey of 21,317 older adults. Depressive symptoms were defined as a Geriatric Depression Scale score of ≥ 5. Participants were queried regarding the average frequency at which they watched sports on-site and via TV/Internet over the past year. Among the 21,317 participants, 4559 (21.4%) had depressive symptoms, while 4808 (22.6%) and 16,576 (77.8%) watched sports on-site and via TV/Internet at least once a year, respectively. Older adults who watched sports on-site a few times/year (prevalence ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.65-0.74) or 1-3 times/month (0.66, 0.53-0.82) were less likely to have depressive symptoms compared to non-spectators after adjusting for frequency of playing sports, exercise activities, and other potential confounders. Meanwhile, a dose-response relationship was confirmed for watching via TV/Internet (prevalence ratio of 0.86, 0.79, and 0.71 for a few times/year, 1-3 times/month, and ≥ 1 time/week, respectively). This study suggested that watching sports on-site or via TV/Internet, regardless of whether they regularly engage in sports, may reduce the risk of depressive symptoms among older adults.",[],Scientific reports,"10.1038/s41598-021-89994-8

33780375,Suzuki et al.,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Quality of Life of Patients with Parkinson's Disease and Their Caregivers: A Single-Center Survey in Tochigi Prefecture.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has negatively affected the mental health of the general population.
We investigated the determinants of quality of life (QOL) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Impacts of lifestyle changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic on 100 patients with PD and their caregivers/spouses were assessed. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to assess anxiety and depression. The physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores of the short form (SF)-8 were used to evaluate health-related QOL.
Regarding health-related QOL, physical function, role physical, general health, vitality and the PCS score were significantly worse in PD patients than in caregivers. Worsening of PD-related symptoms, increased stress, and decreased physical activity were observed in 29.0%, 37.0% and 44.0% of PD patients, respectively. Sixteen patients (16.0%) experienced problems with hospital access, but none reported medication shortages. Strong concerns about COVID-19 were reported by 47.0% of caregivers and 50.0% of PD patients. In PD patients, increased gait disturbance and rigidity, disease severity, smoking, the levodopa equivalent dose and decreased body weight predicted a worse PCS score; anxiety, depression, female sex, stress and long disease duration predicted a worse MCS score. In caregivers, age and smoking contributed to a worse PCS score; depression, stress and worsening patient mood contributed to a worse MCS score.
We report the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on health-related QOL and its determinants in PD patients and their caregivers.","['COVID-19', 'Caregivers', 'Parkinson’s disease', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'quality of life']",Journal of Parkinson's disease,10.3233/JPD-212560,2021-03-30,"[{'lastname': 'Suzuki', 'firstname': 'Keisuke', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Dokkyo Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Numao', 'firstname': 'Ayaka', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Dokkyo Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Komagamine', 'firstname': 'Tomoko', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Dokkyo Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Haruyama', 'firstname': 'Yasuo', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Integrated Research Faculty for Advanced Medical Science, Dokkyo Medical University School of Medicine, Tochigi, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kawasaki', 'firstname': 'Akiko', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Dokkyo Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Funakoshi', 'firstname': 'Kei', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Dokkyo Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Fujita', 'firstname': 'Hiroaki', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Dokkyo Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Suzuki', 'firstname': 'Shiho', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Dokkyo Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Okamura', 'firstname': 'Madoka', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Dokkyo Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Shiina', 'firstname': 'Tomohiko', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Dokkyo Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Hirata', 'firstname': 'Koichi', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Dokkyo Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.'}]",33780375,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""J Parkinsons Dis"""

33401610,"Kim, Cho",Regular Exercise and Depressive Symptoms in Korean Older Adults.,"Prior studies have found that exercise has a positive effect on depressive symptoms in the general population. For older individuals, however, the association between exercise and depressive symptoms is conclusive. We examined whether regular exercise is related to depressive symptoms in 5379 Korean adults aged ≥ 55 years using data from a 2016 survey administered in the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging. We used the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale to assess depressive symptoms. We performed a multivariate logistic regression analysis to investigate the relationship between regular exercise and depressive symptoms, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, self-rated health, number of chronic diseases, body mass index, hand-grip strength, physical disability, cognitive impairment, and health behavior. Interaction terms, including regular exercise and health-related factors, were also added. We found that a lack of regular exercise was significantly related to an increased frequency of depressive symptoms (OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.03-1.35). Moreover, hand-grip strength may increase the effect of regular exercise on depressive symptoms in individuals 65 years and older (OR = 1.01 vs. 1.70, 95% CI = 1.05-1.96). Our results suggest that it is important to encourage older individuals to exercise regularly as a means of relieving depressive symptoms.","['aged', 'depression', 'exercise', 'hand strength']",International journal of environmental research and public health,"10.3390/ijerph18010303

33361668,"Fujihara, Tsuji, Kondo","[Effectiveness of walking point projects with incentives for walking time, physical function, and depression among older people: inverse probability of treatment weighting using propensity scores].","Objectives: This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a walking point project with incentives for increasing walking time, preventing the decline of physical function and worsening depression among older adults. Methods: We used data from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study, which included subjects aged ≥65 years who lived in Yokohama City in 2013 and 2016. We obtained information on the subjects' participation in the ""Yokohama Walking Point (YWP),"" a program launched by Yokohama City in 2014, from the 2016 survey data. We excluded individuals with missing data for sex, age, walking time per day (<30, 30-59, 60-89, or ≥90 min/day), physical function (5 physical function category items on the Kihon Checklist), depression (15-item Geriatric Depression Scale), and participation status in the YWP. We used data from 4,509 eligible respondents. Changes in walking time, physical function, and depression were designated as dependent variables, and participation status in the YWP was designated as the independent variable in the multiple regression analysis with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), after adjusting for demographic variables, socioeconomic status, health status, and behavior. Results: Among the total subjects, 758 (16.8%) participated in the YWP. The IPTW method showed that participants in the YWP had significantly higher walking times (B=3.61, 95% CI: 1.04, 6.17), less decline in physical function, and less depression (B=-0.13, 95% CI: -0.23, -0.03; B=-0.21, 95% CI: -0.42, -0.01) than those who did not participate in the YWP. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the YWP, with incentives, effectively increased walking time and prevented worsening of physical function and depression among older adults. The municipality's health point project, based on the number of steps, is a useful population approach for promoting health among older adults.","['incentives', 'older adults', 'propensity scores', 'walking']",[Nihon koshu eisei zasshi] Japanese journal of public health,10.11236/jph.67.10_734,2020-12-29,"[{'lastname': 'Fujihara', 'firstname': 'Satoko', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Graduate School of Media and Governance, Keio University.\nDepartment of Social Preventive Medical Sciences, Center for Preventive Medical Sciences, Chiba University.'}, {'lastname': 'Tsuji', 'firstname': 'Taishi', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Social Preventive Medical Sciences, Center for Preventive Medical Sciences, Chiba University.\nFaculty of Health and Sport Sciences, University of Tsukuba.'}, {'lastname': 'Kondo', 'firstname': 'Katsunori', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Social Preventive Medical Sciences, Center for Preventive Medical Sciences, Chiba University.\nDepartment of Gerontological Evaluation, Center for Gerontology and Social Science, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology.'}]",33361668,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Nihon Koshu Eisei Zasshi"""
33258004,Brady et al.,Different types of physical activity are positively associated with indicators of mental health and psychological wellbeing in rheumatoid arthritis during COVID-19.,"Nationwide lockdowns during SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) can compromise mental health and psychological wellbeing and limit opportunities for physical activity (PA), particularly in clinical populations, such as people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), who are considered at risk for COVID-19 complications. This study aimed to investigate associations between PA and sedentary time (ST) with indicators of mental health and wellbeing in RA during COVID-19 lockdown, and examine the moderation effects of self-isolating. 345 RA patients completed an online questionnaire measuring PA (NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study Questionnaire), ST (International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form), pain (McGill Pain Questionnaire and Visual Analogue Scale), fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory), depressive and anxious symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and vitality (Subjective Vitality Scale) during the United Kingdom COVID-19 lockdown. Associations between PA and ST with mental health and wellbeing were examined using hierarchical multiple linear regressions. Light PA (LPA) was significantly negatively associated with mental fatigue (β = - .11), depressive symptoms (β = - .14), and positively with vitality (β = .13). Walking was negatively related to physical fatigue (β = - .11) and depressive symptoms (β = - .12) and positively with vitality (β = .15). Exercise was negatively associated with physical (β = - .19) and general (β = - .12) fatigue and depressive symptoms (β = - .09). ST was positively associated with physical fatigue (β = .19). Moderation analyses showed that LPA was related to lower mental fatigue and better vitality in people not self-isolating, and walking with lower physical fatigue in people self-isolating. These findings show the importance of encouraging PA for people with RA during a lockdown period for mental health and wellbeing.","['COVID-19', 'Mental health', 'Physical activity', 'Rheumatoid arthritis', 'Sedentary behaviour', 'Self-isolation']",Rheumatology international,"10.1007/s00296-020-04751-w

33113806,Dziubek et al.,Evaluation of Psychophysical Factors in Individuals with Frailty Syndrome Following a 3-Month Controlled Physical Activity Program.,"The aim of the study was to compare the emotional state and strength-velocity parameters of patients with frailty and pre-frailty syndrome undertaking a 12-week training programme.
The study was completed by 36 individuals, including 17 with frailty syndrome (FS) and 19 with pre-frailty syndrome (PFS). The age of the subjects ranged from 63 to 89 years, with a mean 69.2 years (±5.0). The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Spielberg's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) were used. The strength of knee muscles was evaluated. The above tests were conducted at two time points: before the training sessions (T1); and after 12 weeks of regular training sessions (T2).
After completion of the training programme, statistically significant differences in BDI were observed between the PFS and FS groups (especially in somatic symptoms). Following the training, BDI values in the PFS group were significantly lower (fewer depressive symptoms) than in the FS group. The parameter values describing strength capacities of the lower limbs, both at T1 and T2, proved to be higher in the PFS group.
In individuals with pre-frailty and frailty syndrome, the 3-month physical training programme improved the strength parameters of lower limb muscles. An improvement in mood and reduction in depressive symptoms were only observed in the group of subjects with pre-frailty syndrome. Rehabilitation programmes for people with frailty syndrome should include psychotherapeutic activities in addition to physical training in order to improve the psychophysical condition of patients.","['BDI', 'STAI', 'SWLS', 'exercise', 'frailty syndrome', 'mood', 'muscle strength', 'physiotherapy']",International journal of environmental research and public health,"10.3390/ijerph17217804

32991307,Smaradottir et al.,[Physical activity and depression among older community-dwelling adults in urban and rural areas: Population based study].,"The aim was to explore physical activity (PA) in different daily contexts, among older adults in Northern Iceland; and by urban-rural living, age-group and sex. Moreover, to study the association between PA and depression.
The study was cross-sectional, population based and data was collected in 2017-'18 in Northern Iceland. The 175 community-dwelling participants (participation rate 59.7%) were 65-92 years old, 43% were women, and 40% lived in rural areas. The Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) was used to obtain a total PA score and three subs-scores reflecting PA associated with leisure-time, household and work. The Geriatric Depression Scale was used to detect depressive symptoms.
Total PA was the same for urban and rural people, men were more active than women, and the 65-74 years age-group was more active than the 75-92 years age-group. People in rural areas were more likely to do work-related PA than people in urban areas, as was the 65-74 years age-group compared to the 75-92 years age-group. Men were more PA during household than women. Higher total PA and the sub-scores of PASE had significant association with fewer depressive symptoms. PA in leisure-time was the only PASE sub-score with a significant and independent association with fewer depressive symptoms.
The results improve the knowledge on PA among older community-dwelling adults, and its relationship with depressive symptoms. Although PA in different contexts has various health benefits, an emphasis on leisure-time PA may have the most beneficial effect on mental health.","['Physical activity', 'ageing', 'depressionageing', 'rural', 'urban']",Laeknabladid,10.17992/lbl.2020.10.600,2020-09-30,"[{'lastname': 'Smaradottir', 'firstname': 'Birgitta R', 'initials': 'BR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical Therapy, School of Health Sciences, University of Iceland.'}, {'lastname': 'Kristofersson', 'firstname': 'Gisli K', 'initials': 'GK', 'affiliation': 'School of Health Sciences, University of Akureyri, Akureyri, Iceland.'}, {'lastname': 'Sigurdardottir', 'firstname': 'Arun K', 'initials': 'AK', 'affiliation': 'School of Health Sciences, University of Akureyri, Akureyri, Iceland, School of Health Sciences, University of Akureyri, Akureyri, Iceland; Akureyri Hospital, Akureyri, Iceland.'}, {'lastname': 'Arnadottir', 'firstname': 'Solveig A', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical Therapy, School of Health Sciences, University of Iceland, Research Centre of Movement Science, Department of Physical Therapy, University of Iceland.'}]",32991307,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Laeknabladid"""

Members of a Norwegian fitness association were invited to fill out an online questionnaire including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), sleep disturbances and change in PA habits (decreased, unchanged, increased) during the COVID-19 lockdown from 12 March to 15 June 2020.
A sample of 1281 members aged 19-81 years were included (31% females; mean ± SD age 49 ± 11.5). Prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms was 9.0% and 4.4%, respectively. During the lockdown period, 13.8% reduced, 21.9% increased and 64.3% did not change PA level. In total 21.9% reported sleeping disturbances. Anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms were statistically significantly associated with sleep disturbances. Change in PA did not influence the association between mental health and sleep.
Compared to studies from the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms were substantial lower in this Norwegian sample of relatively physically active adults. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were associated with sleep disturbances, but change in PA level during the COVID-19 lockdown did not influence the association between mental health and sleep disturbances.","['Covid-19', 'Mental health', 'Physical activity', 'Sleep']",Sleep medicine,10.1016/j.sleep.2020.08.030,2020-09-22,"[{'lastname': 'Ernstsen', 'firstname': 'Linda', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health and Nursing, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway.

32819981,Aguilera et al.,mHealth app using machine learning to increase physical activity in diabetes and depression: clinical trial protocol for the DIAMANTE Study.,"Depression and diabetes are highly disabling diseases with a high prevalence and high rate of comorbidity, particularly in low-income ethnic minority patients. Though comorbidity increases the risk of adverse outcomes and mortality, most clinical interventions target these diseases separately. Increasing physical activity might be effective to simultaneously lower depressive symptoms and improve glycaemic control. Self-management apps are a cost-effective, scalable and easy access treatment to increase physical activity. However, cutting-edge technological applications often do not reach vulnerable populations and are not tailored to an individual's behaviour and characteristics. Tailoring of interventions using machine learning methods likely increases the effectiveness of the intervention.
In a three-arm randomised controlled trial, we will examine the effect of a text-messaging smartphone application to encourage physical activity in low-income ethnic minority patients with comorbid diabetes and depression. The adaptive intervention group receives messages chosen from different messaging banks by a reinforcement learning algorithm. The uniform random intervention group receives the same messages, but chosen from the messaging banks with equal probabilities. The control group receives a weekly mood message. We aim to recruit 276 adults from primary care clinics aged 18-75 years who have been diagnosed with current diabetes and show elevated depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale-8 (PHQ-8) >5). We will compare passively collected daily step counts, self-report PHQ-8 and most recent haemoglobin A1c from medical records at baseline and at intervention completion at 6-month follow-up.
The Institutional Review Board at the University of California San Francisco approved this study (IRB: 17-22608). We plan to submit manuscripts describing our user-designed methods and testing of the adaptive learning algorithm and will submit the results of the trial for publication in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at (inter)-national scientific meetings.

32734750,Ravari et al.,The effect of Pilates exercise on the happiness and depression of elderly women: a clinical trial study.,"The available approaches for reducing mental problems, particularly for elderlies, include physical activities and exercise. Pilates is a sport that has received much attention during the past few years. The present study was conducted to explore the influence of Pilates on depression and happiness levels of elderly women.
This randomized trial work was conducted on 60 elderly women referred to the health center of Rafsanjan city, southern Iran. The participants were randomly assigned into two intervention (Pilates) and control groups, each with 30 members. In the intervention group, participants did Pilates three sessions each week for 8 weeks. The control group did not receive any intervention similar to the intervention group. The happiness level of the participants was measured using the Oxford Happiness Inventory (OHI) and their depression was measured using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) before, one month after, and two months after the intervention. A mixed ANOVA was applied for data analysis.
The majority of the participants were married housewives with primary education and age range of above 62 years. Based on the findings of this study, the mean happiness and depression scores of the participants at the end of months one and two in the intervention groups increased significantly compared to those of the control group.
Doing Pilates for 8 weeks may positively affect the depression and happiness levels of the elderly. Thus, it is recommended as a healthy exercise for elderlies.",[],The Journal of sports medicine and physical fitness,10.23736/S0022-4707.20.10730-8,2020-08-01,"[{'lastname': 'Ravari', 'firstname': 'Ali', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Surgical Nursing, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Geriatric Care Research Center, Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Mirzaei', 'firstname': 'Tayebeh', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Surgical Nursing, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Geriatric Care Research Center, Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan, Iran - t.mirzaei@rums.ac.ir.'}, {'lastname': 'Bahremand', 'firstname': 'Rooholah', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'School of Nursing and Midwifery, Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Raeisi', 'firstname': 'Mohadeseh', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Geriatric Care Research Center, Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Kamiab', 'firstname': 'Zahra', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Unit of Clinical Research Development, Department of Family Medicine, School of Medicine, Ali-Ibn Abi-Talib Hospital, Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan, Iran.'}]",32734750,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""J Sports Med Phys Fitness"""
32725510,Brys et al.,Daily physical activity in patients on chronic haemodialysis and its relation with fatigue and depressive symptoms.,"Fatigue and depressed mood are considered main impediments to physical activity in haemodialysis (HD) patients. A better understanding of their interrelationships is crucial to develop effective therapies. Moreover, measurement of daily physical activity (DPA) in HD patients is tricky, as it is usually assessed by subjective self-report questionnaires. Therefore, we aimed to objectively measure sponteanous DPA with motion sensors and to explore its relation with fatigue and depressive symptoms.
DPA was assessed for seven consecutive days in 37 HD patients based on their daily step count measured with the SenseWear™ Armband. The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) were administered to evaluate fatigue and depressed mood.
Median DPA was 2424 steps/day, (IQR:892-4545). In 81% of subjects, DPA felt within a sedentary lifestyle classification, as they made < 5.000 steps/day. DPA did not correlate with fatigue (r
Objective assessment of DPA with motion sensors is feasible in HD patients and allows identifying a sedentary lifestyle. Our results suggest that spontanous DPA is determined by age rather than by fatigue or mood.","['Daily physical activity, Wearable motion sensor', 'Depression', 'Fatigue', 'Haemodialysis']",International urology and nephrology,10.1007/s11255-020-02578-9,2020-07-30,"[{'lastname': 'Brys', 'firstname': 'Astrid D H', 'initials': 'ADH', 'affiliation': 'Divisione Di Nefrologia, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

32713754,Callow et al.,The Mental Health Benefits of Physical Activity in Older Adults Survive the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"To determine the relationship between the amount and intensity of physical activity performed by older adults in North America (United States and Canada) and their depression and anxiety symptoms while currently under social distancing guidelines (SDG) for the COVID-19 pandemic.
Descriptive cross-sectional study.
Online survey conducted between April 9 and April 30, 2020, during the COVD-19 pandemic.
About 1,046 older adults over the age of 50 who live in North America.
Participants were asked about their basic demographic information, current health status, and the impact of the current SDG on their subjective state of mental health. Participants completed the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly, to determine the amount and intensity of physical activity performed, as well as both the Geriatric Depression Scale and Geriatric Anxiety Scale, to ascertain the extent of their depression and anxiety-like symptoms.
Ninety-seven percent of participants indicated that they adhered to current SDG ""Most of the time"" or ""Strictly."" Participants who performed greater levels of physical activity experienced lower levels of depression-like symptoms when age, sex, and education were accounted for; however, no relationship between physical activity and anxiety-like symptoms was found. A hierarchical regression analysis that incorporated the intensity of physical activity performed (light, moderate, and vigorous) in the model indicated that greater light and strenuous activity, but not moderate, predicted lower depression-like symptoms.
These results suggest that performing even light physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic may help alleviate some of the negative mental health impacts that older adults may be experiencing while isolated and adhering to SDG during the COVID-19 pandemic.","['COVID-19', 'Mood', 'activity']",The American journal of geriatric psychiatry : official journal of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry,10.1016/j.jagp.2020.06.024,2020-07-28,"[{'lastname': 'Callow', 'firstname': 'Daniel D', 'initials': 'DD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Kinesiology, University of Maryland (DDC, NAA-N, LSJ, GSP, JW, JCS), College Park, MD; Program in Neuroscience and Cognitive Science, University of Maryland (DDC, LSJ, JCS), College Park, MD.'}, {'lastname': 'Arnold-Nedimala', 'firstname': 'Naomi A', 'initials': 'NA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Kinesiology, University of Maryland (DDC, NAA-N, LSJ, GSP, JW, JCS), College Park, MD.'}, {'lastname': 'Jordan', 'firstname': 'Leslie S', 'initials': 'LS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Kinesiology, University of Maryland (DDC, NAA-N, LSJ, GSP, JW, JCS), College Park, MD; Program in Neuroscience and Cognitive Science, University of Maryland (DDC, LSJ, JCS), College Park, MD.'}, {'lastname': 'Pena', 'firstname': 'Gabriel S', 'initials': 'GS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Kinesiology, University of Maryland (DDC, NAA-N, LSJ, GSP, JW, JCS), College Park, MD.'}, {'lastname': 'Won', 'firstname': 'Junyeon', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Kinesiology, University of Maryland (DDC, NAA-N, LSJ, GSP, JW, JCS), College Park, MD.'}, {'lastname': 'Woodard', 'firstname': 'John L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Wayne State University (JLW), Detroit, MI.'}, {'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'J Carson', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Kinesiology, University of Maryland (DDC, NAA-N, LSJ, GSP, JW, JCS), College Park, MD; Program in Neuroscience and Cognitive Science, University of Maryland (DDC, LSJ, JCS), College Park, MD.

32682939,van Oeijen et al.,Performance and Self-reported Functioning of People With Chronic Idiopathic Axonal Polyneuropathy: A 4-Year Follow-up Study.,"To describe the course of performance of activities (observed and self-reported) of people with chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy (CIAP) over 4 years and to assess the associations with muscle strength, sensory function, and psychological personal factors (intention, perceived behavior control [PBC], and feelings of depression or anxiety).
Prospective observational study with measurement at baseline, 6 months, 1 year, and 4 years.
Outpatient neurology clinic.
People with CIAP (N=92).
Walking was measured using the shuttle-walk test (SWT), a pedometer (mean step count/d), and the ""physical functioning"" subscale of the Short Form-36 questionnaire. Muscle strength and sensory function were measured using a MicroFET handheld dynamometer and the Sensory Modality Sum score. Personal factors were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and intention and PBC were assessed with a protocolized questionnaire.
Multilevel model analysis showed a significant decrease over time in mean scores in performance of activities (SWT, step count), which was associated with older age and loss of muscle strength (SWT: β=73.392, step count: β=676.279, P<.001). Limitations in self-reported functioning (physical functioning) significantly increased and were associated with older age (β=-0.916, P=.001), increased comorbidity (β=-6.978, P=.024), loss of muscle strength (β=7.074, P<.001), low PBC (β=0.744, P<.001), and increased feelings of depression (β=1.481, P<.001).
Performance of activities of people with CIAP decreased over time (SWT, step count, physical functioning). Older age, loss of muscle strength, comorbidity, feelings of depression, and low perceived behavior control were associated with this decrease. However, there were considerable individual differences.","['Polyneuropathies', 'Rehabilitation']",Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,10.1016/j.apmr.2020.06.017,2020-07-20,"[{'lastname': 'van Oeijen', 'firstname': 'Karlijn', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Rijndam Rehabilitation, Rotterdam.

Using isotemporal substitution (IS) models, the aim of this paper was to investigate the effect of substituting SB with LPA or MVPA on associations with mental health in older adults.
Data from 1360 older adults (mean age 75.18 years) in four countries were utilized. PA and SB was measured using ActiGraph wGT3X-BT + accelerometers worn for 7 days. Self-rated mental health was measured using the Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS). IS models estimated cross-sectional associations when 30 minutes of one behavior was substituted with another. Models were adjusted for age, sex, marital status, and educational attainment.
Substituting 30 minutes of SB with LPA (β -.37; 95% CI -0.42, -0.32) or MVPA (β -.14; 95% CI -0.21, -0.07) and substituting LPA with MVPA (β -.11; 95% CI -0.18, -0.04) were associated with improvements in anxiety. However, substituting 30 minutes of SB with LPA (β .55; 95% CI 0.49, 0.62) was associated with increased depression.
Replacing 30 minutes of SB with LPA or MVPA was associated with improved anxiety symptoms in older adults. Greater benefits were observed when shifting SB and LPA to MVPA.","['isotemporal', 'light physical activity', 'mental health', 'moderate-vigorous physical activity', 'older adults']",Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports,10.1111/sms.13762,2020-07-10,"[{'lastname': 'Tully', 'firstname': 'Mark A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'School of Health Sciences, Institute of Mental Health Sciences, Ulster University, Newtownabbey, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'McMullan', 'firstname': 'Ilona', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'School of Health Sciences, Ulster University, Newtownabbey, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Blackburn', 'firstname': 'Nicole E', 'initials': 'NE', 'affiliation': 'School of Health Sciences, Institute of Nursing and Health Research, Centre for Health and Rehabilitation Technologies, Ulster University, Newtownabbey, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Wilson', 'firstname': 'Jason J', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': 'School of Health Sciences, Ulster University, Newtownabbey, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Bunting', 'firstname': 'Brendan', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, Ulster University, Newtownabbey, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'Lee', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'The Cambridge Centre for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Kee', 'firstname': 'Frank', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': ""Centre for Public Health, School of Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Science, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Deidda', 'firstname': 'Manuela', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Health Economics & Health Technology Assessment, Institute of Health & Wellbeing, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Giné-Garriga', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Sport Sciences, Faculty of Psychology, Education and Sport Sciences Blanquerna, Universitat Ramon Llull, Barcelona, Spain.\nDepartment of Physical Therapy, Faculty of Health Sciences Blanquerna, Universitat Ramon Llull, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Coll-Planas', 'firstname': 'Laura', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Fundació Salut i Envelliment, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Dallmeier', 'firstname': 'Dhayana', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Geriatric Centre Ulm/Alb-Donau, AGAPLESION Bethesda Clinic Ulm, Geriatric Research Unit Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.\nDept. of Epidemiology, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Denkinger', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Geriatric Centre Ulm/Alb-Donau, AGAPLESION Bethesda Clinic Ulm, Geriatric Research Unit Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rothenbacher', 'firstname': 'Dietrich', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Epidemiology and Medical Biometry, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Caserotti', 'firstname': 'Paolo', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Sports Science and Clinical Biomechanics, Center for Active and Healthy Ageing (CAHA), University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.'}]",32643826,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,DENIED: Wiley E Publisher says no to https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/sms.13762/pdf

The present study aimed to compare the effects of Walkbot locomotor training (WLT) with conventional locomotor training (CLT) on balance and gait, cardiopulmonary and psychological functions and fall confidence in acute hemiparetic stroke.
Fourteen patients with acute hemiparetic stroke were randomized into either the WLT (60 min physical therapy + 30 min Walkbot-assisted gait training) or CLT (60 min physical therapy + 30 min gait training) groups, 7 days/week over 2 weeks. Clinical outcomes included the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Functional Ambulation Category (FAC), heart rate (HR), Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (BRPE), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and the activities-specific balance confidence (ABC) scale. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted at P < 0.05.

32419522,Barlow et al.,An Evaluation of Service Provision and Novel Strength Assessment on Patient Outcomes in a UK-Based Pulmonary Rehabilitation Setting.,"This study's purpose was to (i) assess the impact of a 7-week pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) programme upon patient outcomes; incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT), COPD assessment tool (CAT), Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS); (ii) assess the impact of COPD severity on ISWT, psychological functioning and quality of life measures following PR; (iii) assess the feasibility of incorporating individually prescribed one repetition maximum (1RM) training loads into the existing strength training programme. Patients were people with COPD enrolled onto one of three versions (locations A, B and C) of a 7-week PR programme, which consisted of group exercise sessions and a social plus education element. Two locations incorporated individually prescribed training loads. Minimal clinically important changes (MCICs) are reported for the ISWT across all locations. Statistically significant changes in both CAT and the CCQ were found, with MCIC's evident for CAT score overall and individually at location B. MCIC's were not found for the CCQ. No statistically significant or MCICs were evident for the HADS. MCIC's were present only in patients with mild to moderate severity for the ISWT. For the CAT, moderate, severe and very severe patients with COPD experienced MCIC's. MCIC's and statistically significant increases in 1RM strength were seen at both locations. These findings evidence an effective PR service. Basic strength exercise programming and assessment are feasible and should be implemented in PR services to maximise patient outcomes.","['COPD', 'Pulmonary rehabilitation', 'service provision']",COPD,10.1080/15412555.2020.1764519,2020-05-19,"[{'lastname': 'Barlow', 'firstname': 'Ruth', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Provide, Colchester, Essex, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Jones', 'firstname': 'Ben', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'School of Sport, Rehabilitation and Exercise Sciences, University of Essex, Colchester, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Rogerson', 'firstname': 'Mike', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'School of Sport, Rehabilitation and Exercise Sciences, University of Essex, Colchester, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Bannister', 'firstname': 'Hannah', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Provide, Colchester, Essex, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Stuart', 'firstname': 'Rebecca', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Provide, Colchester, Essex, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Iqbal', 'firstname': 'Jawadh', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'School of Health and Social Care, University of Essex, Colchester, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Andrews', 'firstname': 'Leanne', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'School of Health and Social Care, University of Essex, Colchester, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Easton', 'firstname': 'Izzie', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'School of Sport, Rehabilitation and Exercise Sciences, University of Essex, Colchester, UK.'}]",32419522,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""COPD"""
32388071,Kitagaki et al.,Relationship between exercise capacity and depressive symptoms in community-dwelling older adults.,"Depressive symptoms cannot be ignored when exercise intervention is performed. The purpose of this study was to clarify the association between depressive symptoms and exercise capacity in community-dwelling older adults.
In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed 110 community-dwelling older adults (mean age [standard deviation] = 70.7 [4.0] years old; women: 55 %). Depressive symptoms were measured using a Japanese version of the Geriatric Depression Scale. We evaluated exercise capacity by measuring distance (2MWD) during a 2-minute walk test. Linear regression models were applied to analyze the association between 2MWD and depressive symptoms.
The results suggest that depressive symptoms are associated with low 2MWD (beta = -5.87, 95 % confidence interval = -11.18 to -0.57, p <  0.05) even after adjusting for age, gender, Body Mass Index, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, pain severity, and the number of comorbidities.
The results indicated that depressive symptoms are associated with decreased exercise capacity in older adults.","['Aged', 'Community-dwelling', 'Depressive symptoms', 'Exercise capacity']",Archives of gerontology and geriatrics,10.1016/j.archger.2020.104084,2020-05-11,"[{'lastname': 'Kitagaki', 'firstname': 'Kazufumi', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cardiovascular Rehabilitation, National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center, 6-1 Kishibeshinmach Suita, Osaka 564-8565, Japan; Department of Public Health, Kobe University Graduate School of Health Sciences, 7-10-2, Tomogaoka, Suma, Kobe 654-0142, Japan.

32333551,Nguy et al.,"The Associations Between Physical Activity, Sleep, and Mood with Pain in People with Parkinson's Disease: An Observational Cross-Sectional Study.","Pain is common in Parkinson's disease (PD). In general and chronic pain populations, physical inactivity, poor sleep, and anxiety are associated with worse pain. However, little is known about these potential predictors of pain in PD.
This cross-sectional observational study investigated associations between measures of physical activity, sleep, and mood with pain in people with PD.
Pain was measured using the King's PD Pain Scale and the Brief Pain Inventory (pain severity and interference) in 52 participants with PD. Independent variables were categorised by demographics (age, gender), disease severity (MDS-UPDRS) and duration, central sensitization (Central Sensitization Inventory), physical activity (Incidental and Planned Exercise Questionnaire), sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), and mood (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale).
Univariate regression analyses showed that increased disease severity, longer disease duration, greater central sensitization, increased physical activity, poor sleep, anxiety, and depression were associated with worse pain in one or more pain measures (p < 0.05). Multivariate regression models accounted for 56% of the variance in the King's Pain Scale, 25% pain severity and 36% in pain interference. Poor sleep independently contributed to worse pain scores in all models (β 0.3-0.4, p < 0.05).
Increased physical activity, poor sleep, anxiety, and depression are associated with worse pain scores in people with PD. For optimal management of pain in people with PD, sleep and mood may need to be addressed. Further, the nature of the relationship between physical activity and pain in PD requires further investigation.","['Parkinson’s disease', 'anxiety', 'depression', 'pain', 'physical activity', 'sleep']",Journal of Parkinson's disease,10.3233/JPD-201938,2020-04-26,"[{'lastname': 'Nguy', 'firstname': 'Vanessa', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Barry', 'firstname': 'Benjamin K', 'initials': 'BK', 'affiliation': 'School of Medical Sciences, University of New South Wales, Australia.\nNeuroscience Research Australia, Australia.\nSchool of Clinical Medicine, The University of Queensland, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Moloney', 'firstname': 'Niamh', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Sciences, Macquarie University, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Hassett', 'firstname': 'Leanne M', 'initials': 'LM', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Australia.\nSchool of Public Health, The University of Sydney, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Canning', 'firstname': 'Colleen G', 'initials': 'CG', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Lewis', 'firstname': 'Simon J G', 'initials': 'SJG', 'affiliation': 'The Brain and Mind Centre, The University of Sydney, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Allen', 'firstname': 'Natalie E', 'initials': 'NE', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Australia.'}]",32333551,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""J Parkinsons Dis"""

Two-hundred twenty-three adult CRC survivors within 1 year of completion of primary cancer treatment were randomized to receive dietary, PA or combined intervention, or usual care for a 12 monthduration, under a 2 (diet vs usual care) × 2 (PA vs usual care) factorial design. Generic and cancer-specific QoL was assessed using a Chinese version 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Colorectal (FACT-C) scale, respectively. Anxiety and depression was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Linear mixed models were used for examining the intervention effects.
Participants receiving dietary intervention experienced a significant improvement in the generic measure of QoL (SF-6D utility scores, mean difference 0.042, 95%CI 0.03 to 0.081) at 12 months, the cancer-specific QoL scores (mean difference 3.09, 95%CI 0.13 to 6.04), and levels of depression (P = 0.015) at both 12 and 24 months follow-up. Participants receiving PA intervention only demonstrated a significant improvement in SF-6D utility index (mean difference 0.039, 95%CI 0.002 to 0.077) and physical functioning (mean difference 2.85, 95%CI 1.00 to 4.70) at 6 months.
Dietary intervention improved the generic and cancer-specific QoL and depression in CRC survivors.

32030520,Hattori et al.,Subjects at risk of Parkinson's disease in health checkup examinees: cross-sectional analysis of baseline data of the NaT-PROBE study.,"The present study aimed to survey the prevalence of prodromal symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) in Japanese health checkup examinees, for identifying at-risk subjects.
We conducted a questionnaire survey of annual health checkup examinees without neurological symptoms using the following self-reported questionnaires: Japanese version of the Scale for Outcomes in Parkinson's disease for Autonomic Symptoms (SCOPA-AUT); Self-administered Odor Question (SAOQ); REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Screening Scale (RBDSQ); Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II); Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS); and Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE). The presence of prodromal symptoms was determined using the 90th percentile threshold of each questionnaire. Subjects ≥ 50 years of age with ≥ 2 core prodromal symptoms (dysautonomia, hyposmia, and RBD), were classified as at risk.
Between March 2017 and March 2018, 4,953 participants sufficiently answered the questionnaires. Among 2,726 subjects ≥ 50 years of age, 155 were classified as at risk. These subjects had worse values of BDI-II (12.0 ± 8.3 vs. 4.4 ± 3.8, p < 0.001) and ESS (9.6 ± 5.0 vs. 6.3 ± 3.2, p < 0.001), in addition to SCOPA-AUT, SAOQ, and RBDSQ. Male at-risk subjects showed lower values of hemoglobin (14.8 ± 1.3 vs. 15.0 ± 1.1, p = 0.032) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (114.5 ± 30.3 vs. 123.0 ± 28.9, p = 0.004) than the examinees reporting no prodromal symptoms.
Approximately 6% of the population aged 50 years or older was at risk for PD. Male at-risk subjects had mild hematological and metabolic changes relevant to PD.","['All movement disorders', 'Dementia with Lewy bodies', 'Parkinson’s disease/parkinsonism', 'Risk factors in epidemiology']",Journal of neurology,"10.1007/s00415-020-09714-6

31994627,Reis et al.,Comparison of quality of life and functionality in type 2 diabetics with and without insulin.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus compromises physical, psychological, economic, and social life.
To identify and compare the quality of life, depression, functional performance, and physical activity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who use insulin or not.
A observational, descriptive, cross-sectional, comparative study involving 100 patients (50 use insulin and 50 do not) from a Teaching Hospital. Questionnaires used: Identification and Socioeconomic Profile; SF-36; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; Visual Analogue Scale for Pain; Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, and International Physical Activity Questionnaire.
Sample composed predominantly by middle-aged, female, married, retired, and with incomplete elementary school individuals. There is impairment in all domains of quality of life, being more intense in functional capacity, physical limitations, pain, social aspects, limitation by emotional aspects, and mental health (P<0.05). There is a significant prevalence of anxiety or depressive symptoms in the groups, especially in those using insulin. However, the occurrence of the corresponding psychiatric disorders is unlikely (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in neuropathic pain between the groups (P=0.2296). Functional impairment is similar in both groups regarding self-care activities (P=0.4494) and productivity (P=0.5759), with a greater deterioration of leisure time in patients on insulin (P=0.0091). Most of them practice physical activity, predominantly walking, with no significant difference when comparing the groups (P>0.05), as well as in the other modalities.
Insulinized patients present greater impairment of functional capacity and socialization, as well as greater neuropathic pain, anxiety, and depressive symptoms.",[],Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira (1992),10.1590/1806-9282.65.12.1464,2020-01-30,"[{'lastname': 'Reis', 'firstname': 'Ana Carolina Dos', 'initials': 'ACD', 'affiliation': '.

31979038,Yuan et al.,Effect of Frequency of Exercise on Cognitive Function in Older Adults: Serial Mediation of Depression and Quality of Sleep.,"Sleep quality and depression are two reciprocal causation socioemotional factors and their roles in the relationship between physical exercise and cognition are still unclear.
A face-to-face survey of 3230 older adults aged 60+ was conducted in Xiamen, China, in 2016. Frequency of exercise (FOE) referred to the number of days of exercise per week. Quality of sleep (QOS) was categorized into five levels: very poor/poor/fair/good/excellent. The 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were used to measure depression (DEP) and cognitive function (CF), respectively. Serial multiple mediator models were used. All mediation analyses were analyzed using the SPSS PROCESS macro.
2469 respondents had valid data with mean scores for GDS-15 and MoCA being 1.87 and 21.61, respectively. The direct path from FOE to CF was significant (c'= 0.20, 
FOE is a protective factor of CF in older adults. Moreover, CF is influenced by QOS through DEP, without which the working path may disappear.","['cognitive function', 'depression', 'effect of frequency', 'quality of sleep', 'serial mediation']",International journal of environmental research and public health,"10.3390/ijerph17030709

31951860,Ploughman et al.,"Under-treated depression negatively impacts lifestyle behaviors, participation and health-related quality of life among older people with multiple sclerosis.","To what extent depression may negatively impact successful aging with multiple sclerosis (MS) is not known. We examined the impact of depression/depressive symptoms on lifestyle choices (diet, exercise, smoking and alcohol), participation and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among older people living with MS (n = 742).
Based on self-reported depression diagnosis and scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, we divided the sample into four groups: 1. No depression diagnosis and low symptoms (n = 412), 2. Diagnosed with depression and low symptoms (n = 103), 3. Diagnosed with depression and high symptoms (n = 87), and 4. No depression diagnosis and high symptoms (n = 140). We used regression modelling to predict outcomes, controlling for age, MS disease duration, type of MS at initial diagnosis and disability.
A high proportion (44.5%) reported either being diagnosed with depression, having high levels of symptoms or both. Only 12.1% reported that they were prescribed anti-depressants and 13.6% utilized psychosocial services. Compared to those with depression who had low symptoms, respondents who had high depressive symptoms (n = 227) were more likely to be non-exercisers (OR 1.85, 95%CI 1.02-3.34, p = 0.042), consume a poor diet (OR 2.12, 95%CI 1.27-3.52, p = 0.004), have the lowest levels of participation (OR 3.36, 95%CI 1.74-6.49, p = 0.0003) and report the poorest HRQoL (OR 1.95, 95%CI 1.17-3.26, p = 0.011). Men and people experiencing higher levels of disability and fatigue were at greater risk of having high symptoms and being undiagnosed.
Undiagnosed and under-treated depression is common among older people living with MS and adversely impacts health choices.","['Aging', 'Antidepressant', 'Depression', 'Health services', 'Multiple sclerosis', 'Quality of life']",Multiple sclerosis and related disorders,10.1016/j.msard.2019.101919,2020-01-18,"[{'lastname': 'Ploughman', 'firstname': 'Michelle', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Medicine, Memorial University of Newfoundland, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.

Subjects with a diagnosis of COPD alone or ACO were evaluated and compared before and after a high-intensity ET program composed of walking and cycling plus strengthening exercises of the upper and lower limbs (3 days/week, 3 months, 36 sessions). Assessments included spirometry, bioelectrical impedance, 6-min walk test (6MWT), London Chest Activity of Daily Living Scale (LCADL), Hospital anxiety and depression Scale, modified Medical Research Council Scale (mMRC), Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and respiratory and peripheral muscle strength [manovacuometry and 1-repetition maximum test (quadriceps femoris, biceps and triceps brachialis), respectively]. ACO was defined according to Sin et al. (Eur Respir J 48(3):664-673, 2016).

31860135,Mandelblatt et al.,Symptom burden among older breast cancer survivors: The Thinking and Living With Cancer (TLC) study.,"Little is known about longitudinal symptom burden, its consequences for well-being, and whether lifestyle moderates the burden in older survivors.
The authors report on 36-month data from survivors aged ≥60 years with newly diagnosed, nonmetastatic breast cancer and noncancer controls recruited from August 2010 through June 2016. Symptom burden was measured as the sum of self-reported symptoms/diseases as follows: pain (yes or no), fatigue (on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy [FACT]-Fatigue scale), cognitive (on the FACT-Cognitive scale), sleep problems (yes or no), depression (on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale), anxiety (on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), and cardiac problems and neuropathy (yes or no). Well-being was measured using the FACT-General scale, with scores from 0 to 100. Lifestyle included smoking, alcohol use, body mass index, physical activity, and leisure activities. Mixed models assessed relations between treatment group (chemotherapy with or without hormone therapy, hormone therapy only, and controls) and symptom burden, lifestyle, and covariates. Separate models tested the effects of fluctuations in symptom burden and lifestyle on function.
All groups reported high baseline symptoms, and levels remained high over time; differences between survivors and controls were most notable for cognitive and sleep problems, anxiety, and neuropathy. The adjusted burden score was highest among chemotherapy-exposed survivors, followed by hormone therapy-exposed survivors versus controls (P < .001). The burden score was related to physical, emotional, and functional well-being (eg, survivors with lower vs higher burden scores had 12.4-point higher physical well-being scores). The composite lifestyle score was not related to symptom burden or well-being, but physical activity was significantly associated with each outcome (P < .005).
Cancer and its treatments are associated with a higher level of actionable symptoms and greater loss of well-being over time in older breast cancer survivors than in comparable noncancer populations, suggesting the need for surveillance and opportunities for intervention.","['breast cancer', 'older patients', 'survivorship', 'symptom burden', 'well-being']",Cancer,10.1002/cncr.32663,2019-12-21,"[{'lastname': 'Mandelblatt', 'firstname': 'Jeanne S', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Oncology, Georgetown University, Washington, DC.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhai', 'firstname': 'Wanting', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics, Bioinformatics, and Biomathematics, Georgetown University, Washington, DC.'}, {'lastname': 'Ahn', 'firstname': 'Jaeil', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics, Bioinformatics, and Biomathematics, Georgetown University, Washington, DC.'}, {'lastname': 'Small', 'firstname': 'Brent J', 'initials': 'BJ', 'affiliation': 'School of Aging Studies, University of South Florida, and Senior Member, H.

this was a cross-sectional study carried out with elderly individuals at PHCs in Maringá city; we used a questionnaire comprising sociodemographic questions, the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ); we analyzed associations and compared depression markers with sociodemographic variables and health conditions.
645 elderly people took part in the study; those with the highest depression markers had lower income, poor health perception, a history of falls and three or more comorbidities; the physically active elderly had lower depression markers.
monthly income and health conditions are factors that influence depression markers; doing light physical activities is associated with lower tendency of depression in the elderly.

While exercise relates to better cognitive health, a hallmark of HF is exercise intolerance. The study objective was to explore whether light-to-moderate exercise improves cognitive function in patients with HF.
This was an exploratory parallel design study of 69 patients with symptomatic HF (mean age = 65, SD = 10), recruited from VA and University of California, San Diego Healthcare Systems. Participants were randomized to Tai Chi (TC) (n = 24), resistance band (RB) exercise (n = 22) or treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 23). The primary outcome was change in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores. We further explored if changes in Beck Depression Inventory - IA (BDI-IA) scores or inflammation biomarkers, CRP, TNFα and IL-6 related to altered cognitive function.
There was a fixed effect of group for MoCA scores changes (F = 8.07, p = .001). TC and RB groups had greater MoCA score increases versus TAU, but no differences were found between TC and RB. Depression symptom changes predicted altered MoCA scores (ΔR

31752823,Faleschini et al.,"Women's perceived social support: associations with postpartum weight retention, health behaviors and depressive symptoms.","Social support may promote healthful behaviors that prevent excess weight at critical periods in women's life. Our objective was to investigate associations of social support at 6 months postpartum with women's health behaviors that have previously been shown to predict weight retention at 1 year postpartum.
At 6 months postpartum in Project Viva, a pre-birth prospective cohort in Massachusetts, women reported social support using the Turner Support Scale, depressive symptoms using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, diet using PrimeScreen, average number of hours walking, light/moderate and vigorous physical activity, television viewing, and sleeping each day.
Among 1356 women, greater partner support was associated with higher levels of walking (OR 1.36, 95% CI [1.01, 1.82]) and intake of fiber (OR 1.43, 95% CI [1.06, 1.91]) and lower intake of trans-fat (OR 1.49, 95% CI [1.11, 2.01]). Support from family/friends was marginally related to healthful levels of light/moderate physical activity (OR 1.26, 95% CI [0.96, 1.65]) and television viewing (OR 1.29, 95% CI [0.99, 1.69]). Both sources of support were strongly associated with lower odds of incident depression (OR 0.33, 95% CI [0.20, 0.55] and OR 0.49, 95% CI [0.30, 0.79], respectively). We did not find associations with vigorous physical activity or sleep duration.
Social support is important to the physical and mental health of new mothers and may promote behaviors that limit postpartum weight retention.","['Body weight changes', 'Depression, Postpartum', 'Health behaviors', 'Social support']",BMC women's health,"10.1186/s12905-019-0839-6

Ongoing cohort study.
117 patients older than 69 years on hemodialysis; 75 men.
Frailty was measured with the frailty phenotype, disability in basic and instrumental activities of daily living with the Barthel and Lawton index respectively, physical function with the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), cognitive status with the Mini Cognitive Examination, and depression with the Yesavage´s Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), at hemodialysis initiation and after 12-month follow-up. Inflammatory and nutrition profile was determined with C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, and haemoglobin levels.
The mean age of the participants was 78.1 years; 63 (53.8 %) were frail. Frail participants had a higher 12-month mortality risk compared to the non frail ones, hazard ratio 2.6 (95 % CI 0.9-7.9). Frail 12-month survivors presented an improvement in median GDS scores (10 to 9; p = .009). There was no change in frail survivors from SPPB ≤ 6 to SPPB > 6 and a shift in 29.3 % of non-frail survivors from SPPB > 6 to SPPB ≤ 6 (p = .007) after 12-month follow-up. Median CRP and haemoglobin levels improved in frail 12-month survivors from 13.9 to 8.3 mg/dL (p = .019) and 9.9-11.1 g/dL (p < .001) respectively.
Frail older adults that initiate hemodialysis present higher mortality than the non-frail ones at 12-month follow-up.

31740113,Vancampfort et al.,Sedentary behavior and depression among community-dwelling adults aged ≥50 years: Results from the irish longitudinal study on Ageing.,"Sedentary behavior (SB) may be a risk factor for depression in middle- and old age adults. The aim of this study was to examine cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between SB and depression in a large national sample of Irish people aged 50 and older taking into account a wide range of previously identified influential factors.
Data from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing survey were analyzed (wave 1: 2009-2011, wave 2: 2012-2013). Depression was assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale. Total weekday SB and control variables were self-reported. Multivariable logistic regression and mediation analysis were conducted to assess the associations.
The final sample consisted of 6903 individuals aged ≥50 years (63.6 ± 9.2years; 52.1% female). After full adjustment for age, gender, social class, current smoking, physical activity, mobility, pain, cognition, chronic physical conditions, disability, anxiety, loneliness, and social network, the association between SB and depression was not statistically significant (OR=1.06; 95%CI=0.60-1.89). Mediation analysis showed that the association is explained by social network (mediated percentage 23.1%), physical activity (20.3%), loneliness (13.2%), chronic physical conditions (11.1%), and disability (7.9%). Cross-sectional analysis showed that SB is significantly associated with depression even after full adjustment.
SB was self-reported.

31658460,Moraes et al.,Is Strength Training as Effective as Aerobic Training for Depression in Older Adults? A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"This study aimed to compare the effects of aerobic training (AT), strength training (ST) and low-intensity exercise in a control group (CG) as adjunct treatments to pharmacotherapy for major depressive disorder (MDD) in older persons.
Older persons clinically diagnosed with MDD (n = 27) and treated with antidepressants were blindly randomized into three groups: AT, ST and a CG. All patients were evaluated prior to and 12 weeks after the intervention.
Compared with the CG, the AT and ST groups showed significant reductions in depressive symptoms (treatment -response = 50% decrease in the pre- to postintervention assessment) through the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (AT group: χ2, p = 0.044) and Beck Depression Inventory (ST group: χ2, p = 0.044).
Adding AT or ST with moderate intensity to the usual treatment promoted a greater reduction of MDD symptoms.","['Elderly patients', 'Mental health', 'Physical exercise']",Neuropsychobiology,10.1159/000503750,2019-10-29,"[{'lastname': 'Moraes', 'firstname': 'Helena S', 'initials': 'HS', 'affiliation': 'Laboratório de Neurociência do Exercício, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, helenasmoraes@gmail.com.\nPrograma de Pós-Graduação em Psiquiatria e Saúde Mental, Instituto de Psiquiatria, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, helenasmoraes@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Silveira', 'firstname': 'Heitor S', 'initials': 'HS', 'affiliation': 'Laboratório de Neurociência do Exercício, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Oliveira', 'firstname': 'Natacha A', 'initials': 'NA', 'affiliation': 'Laboratório de Neurociência do Exercício, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Matta Mello Portugal', 'firstname': 'Eduardo', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Laboratório de Neurociência do Exercício, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Araújo', 'firstname': 'Narahyana B', 'initials': 'NB', 'affiliation': 'Programa de Pós-Graduação em Psiquiatria e Saúde Mental, Instituto de Psiquiatria, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Vasques', 'firstname': 'Paulo E', 'initials': 'PE', 'affiliation': 'Laboratório de Neurociência do Exercício, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Bergland', 'firstname': 'Astrid', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiotherapy, Faculty of Health Sciences, Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Santos', 'firstname': 'Tony M', 'initials': 'TM', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Educação Física, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Engedal', 'firstname': 'Knut', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Norwegian Centre for Aging and Health, Vestfold Health Trust and the University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Coutinho', 'firstname': 'Evandro S', 'initials': 'ES', 'affiliation': 'Instituto de Medicina Social da Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (UERJ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Schuch', 'firstname': 'Felipe B', 'initials': 'FB', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Métodos e Técnicas Desportivas, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, Santa Maria, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Laks', 'firstname': 'Jerson', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Programa de Pós-Graduação em Psiquiatria e Saúde Mental, Instituto de Psiquiatria, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\nPrograma de Pós-Graduação em Biomedicina Translacional, Universidade do Grande Rio (Unigranrio), Duque de Caxias, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Deslandes', 'firstname': 'Andrea C', 'initials': 'AC', 'affiliation': 'Laboratório de Neurociência do Exercício, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\nPrograma de Pós-Graduação em Psiquiatria e Saúde Mental, Instituto de Psiquiatria, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.'}]",31658460,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,TXERROR: 403 status returned from Karger url (http://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/503750)
31595604,Wang et al.,Relationship between neighbourhood social participation and depression among older adults: A longitudinal study in China.,"Previous research has found a negative linkage between neighbourhood social participation and depressive symptoms in Western countries, but the cross-sectional design of these studies limits the ability to infer causality. Little attention has been paid to socio-psychological pathways linking neighbourhood social participation to depressive symptoms among older adults in China. This study aimed to examine the impact of neighbourhood social participation on depressive symptoms among older adults in China. It also further explored the mediating roles of physical activity, social contact among neighbours, and contact with own children in the relationship between social participation and depressive symptoms. Data obtained through three waves (2011, 2013, and 2015) of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study were used. The sample consisted of 10,105 individuals aged 60 and above and 24,623 person-year records captured during these three waves. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiology Studies of Depression scale. Results showed that respondents' depression decreased with an increasing level of neighbourhood social participation, more time spent on physical activities, and a higher frequency of contact with neighbours and with own children. These factors were found to partly mediate the relationship between neighbourhood social participation and depression. The negative relationships between social contact and depression and contact with own children and depression were both strengthened by neighbourhood social participation. In conclusion, physical activity, social contact among neighbours and contact with own children are mechanisms through which neighbourhood social participation lowers the risk of depression among older adults in China.","['China', 'depression', 'longitudinal study', 'mediating effect', 'neighbourhood social participation', 'older adults']",Health & social care in the community,10.1111/hsc.12859,2019-10-09,"[{'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Ruoyu', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'School of Geography and Planning, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.\nGuangdong Key Laboratory for Urbanization and Geo-Simulation, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Feng', 'firstname': 'Zhixin', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'School of Primary Care, Population Sciences and Medical Education, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Ye', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'School of Geography and Planning, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.\nGuangdong Key Laboratory for Urbanization and Geo-Simulation, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Lu', 'firstname': 'Yi', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Architecture and Civil Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.\nCity University of Hong Kong Shenzhen Research Institute, Shenzhen, China.'}]",31595604,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Health Soc Care Community"""
31565752,Bovim et al.,Relationship between pre-stroke physical activity and symptoms of post-stroke anxiety and depression: An observational study.,"To explore mechanisms affecting mental health in patients with stroke. The aims were to investigate the association between pre-stroke physical activity and symptoms of anxiety and depression 3 months after stroke, and to investigate how self-reported physical activity changed from before to 3 months after the stroke.
Secondary analyses of a prospective observational multicentre study.
Stroke patients from 11 Norwegian stroke units.
Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and physical activity was assessed by self-report. Negative binomial regression was used to analyse associations.
The analysed sample consisted of 205 patients; mean age was 74 years (standard deviation (SD) 11.5); 46% were women. Higher activity levels before stroke were associated with fewer symptoms of depression in multivariable analyses with regression coefficient of 0.84 (95% confidence interval 0.73-0.97), p = 0.015. Eighty-five (41.5%) patients reported similar activity levels before and after stroke.
In this group of patients with mild symptoms of emotional distress, it seems that pre-stroke physical activity might be protective against post-stroke depression, but not anxiety. Many patients with mild-to-moderate stroke report being equally active before and after the stroke.","['cerebrovascular disease', 'depression', 'exercise', 'mental health', 'physical activity']",Journal of rehabilitation medicine,10.2340/16501977-2610,2019-10-01,"[{'lastname': 'Bovim', 'firstname': 'Martina Reiten', 'initials': 'MR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuromedicine and Movement Science, Trondheim, Norway. martina.r.bovim@ntnu.no.'}, {'lastname': 'Indredavik', 'firstname': 'Bent', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hokstad', 'firstname': 'Anne', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Cumming', 'firstname': 'Toby', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bernhardt', 'firstname': 'Julie', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Askim', 'firstname': 'Torunn', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}]",31565752,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""J Rehabil Med"""
31551094,Hart et al.,Dietary patterns are associated with depressive symptoms in older Australian women but not men.,"Studies have examined the association between depressive symptoms and dietary patterns; however, only few studies focused on older adults. The present study examines the association between current and past dietary patterns and depression in a community-dwelling adult population aged 55 years and over. Adults (n 4082) were recruited into the Wellbeing, Eating and Exercise for a Long Life study in Victoria, Australia. In 2010 and 2014, data were collected using self-administered questionnaires including a 111-item FFQ, the RAND thirty-six-item Short Form Health Survey of health-related quality of life and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale in 2014. Current (2014) and past (2010) dietary patterns were determined using principal component analysis. Association between dietary patterns and depressive symptoms was assessed using a mixed model analysis with adjustment for covariates. Two similar dietary patterns were identified in men and women (n 2142). In women, a healthy dietary pattern (characterised by frequent intake of vegetables, fruits and fish) was associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms (current diet: β = -0·260, 95 % CI -0·451, -0·070; past diet: β = -0·201, 95 % CI -0·390, -0·013). A current unhealthy dietary pattern in women (characterised by frequent intake of red and processed meat, potatoes, hot chips, cakes, deserts and ice cream) was associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms (β = 1·367, 95 % CI 0·679, 2·056). No associations were identified in men. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to understand the differences that may occur by sex.","['Cohort studies', 'Depression', 'Dietary patterns', 'Older adults']",The British journal of nutrition,10.1017/S0007114519002435,2019-09-26,"[{'lastname': 'Hart', 'firstname': 'Michael J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences, Institute for Physical Activity and Nutrition, Deakin University, Geelong, VIC 3220, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Milte', 'firstname': 'Catherine M', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': 'School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences, Institute for Physical Activity and Nutrition, Deakin University, Geelong, VIC 3220, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Torres', 'firstname': 'Susan J', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': 'School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences, Institute for Physical Activity and Nutrition, Deakin University, Geelong, VIC 3220, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Thorpe', 'firstname': 'Maree G', 'initials': 'MG', 'affiliation': 'School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences, Institute for Physical Activity and Nutrition, Deakin University, Geelong, VIC 3220, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'McNaughton', 'firstname': 'Sarah A', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': 'School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences, Institute for Physical Activity and Nutrition, Deakin University, Geelong, VIC 3220, Australia.'}]",31551094,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Br J Nutr"""
31539696,Carroll et al.,"Associations between depressive symptoms, cigarette smoking, and cardiovascular health: Longitudinal results from CARDIA.","Depression is associated with increased risk of incident and recurrent cardiovascular disease, while the association between depression and cardiovascular health (CVH) remains unknown. Because the natural course of depression varies widely, different patterns of depression, as well as co-occurring factors such as cigarette smoking, may influence this relationship. We examined potential interactions between longitudinal patterns of depression and smoking with CVH.
Using data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, we modeled trajectories of depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale scores; Years 5, 10, 15, 20) and smoking (cigarettes/day; Years 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20). We calculated a modified American Heart Association (AHA) CVH Score (weight, blood glucose, cholesterol, blood pressure, physical activity, and diet; Year 20); higher scores indicate better CVH. Generalized linear models evaluated associations between depression trajectories, smoking trajectories, and their interaction with CVH Score.
The depression trajectory x smoking trajectory interaction was not associated with CVH Score, but main effects of depression trajectory (p < .001) and smoking trajectory (p < .001) were observed. Participants with patterns of subthreshold depression (β = -0.26, SE=0.08), increasing depression (β = -0.51 SE = 0.14), and high depression (β = -0.65, SE = 0.32) had lower CVH Scores than those without depression. Compared to never smokers, participants who quit smoking had higher CVH Scores (β = 0.38, SE = 0.11), while participants with the greatest smoking exposure had lower CVH Scores (β = -0.49, SE = 0.22).
CVH Scores were adapted from the AHA guidelines based on the available CARDIA data.
Deleterious depression and smoking trajectories are independently but not synergistically associated with worse CVH.","['Cardiovascular health', 'Depression', 'Health risk behaviors', 'Prospective study', 'Smoking', 'Trajectory modeling']",Journal of affective disorders,10.1016/j.jad.2019.09.049,2019-09-21,"[{'lastname': 'Carroll', 'firstname': 'Allison J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA; Division of Cardiac Surgery, Department of Surgery, Northwestern Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.

31453968,Ganasarajah et al.,Objective measures of physical performance associated with depression and/or anxiety in midlife Singaporean women.,"The aim of this study was to identify correlates of depression and anxiety in midlife Asian women, with a special focus on the potential role of objectively measured physical performance.
Sociodemographic characteristics, reproductive health, menopause status, medical history, lifestyle choices, physical activity, and physical performance of healthy women aged 45 to 69 attending routine gynecologic care were collected. Depressive symptoms were assessed utilizing the Center for Epidemiologic Studies for Depression Scale (CES-D) and anxiety symptoms by the General Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). Upper body physical performance was assessed by handgrip strength, and lower body physical performance was assessed by the Short Physical Performance Battery. Chi-square tests and multivariable models were used to assess the crude and adjusted associations, respectively, between the studied risk factors and depression and/or anxiety. The main outcome measures were elevated depressive symptoms ≥16 on the CES-D, and/or elevated anxiety symptoms >10 on the GAD-7 score.
Of 1,159 women (mean age 56.3 ± 6.2), 181 (15.9%) were identified as having depressive and/or anxiety symptoms. Weak upper body (handgrip strength) and poor lower body strength (longer duration to complete the repeated chair stand test) were associated with elevated depressive and/or anxiety symptoms (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.68; 95% CI, 1.18-2.40) and (aOR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.09-1.63), respectively.
Weak upper and lower body physical performances were associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms in midlife Singaporean women. Future trials are required to determine whether strengthening exercises that improve physical performance could help reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms in midlife women. : Video Summary: Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/MENO/A419.",[],"Menopause (New York, N.Y.)",10.1097/GME.0000000000001355,2019-08-28,"[{'lastname': 'Ganasarajah', 'firstname': 'Shamini', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, National University Hospital, National University of Singapore, Singapore.'}, {'lastname': 'Sundström Poromaa', 'firstname': 'Inger', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.""}, {'lastname': 'Thu', 'firstname': 'Win Pa', 'initials': 'WP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, National University Hospital, National University of Singapore, Singapore.'}, {'lastname': 'Kramer', 'firstname': 'Michael S', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': 'Departments of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health and of Pediatrics, McGill University Faculty of Medicine, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Logan', 'firstname': 'Susan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, National University Hospital, National University of Singapore, Singapore.'}, {'lastname': 'Cauley', 'firstname': 'Jane A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA.'}, {'lastname': 'Yong', 'firstname': 'Eu-Leong', 'initials': 'EL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, National University Hospital, National University of Singapore, Singapore.'}]",31453968,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,DENIED: wolterskluwer did not provide PDF link for this article

Patients with heart failure (n = 70, mean age = 66 yr, range = 45-89 yr) were randomized to 16 wk of tai chi (TC), resistance band (RB) exercise, or TAU.
Physical function differed by group from baseline to follow-up, measured by distance walked in the 6-min walk test (F = 3.19, P = .03). Tai chi participants demonstrated a nonsignificant decrease of 162 ft (95% confidence interval [CI], 21 to -345, P = .08) while distance walked by RB participants remained stable with a nonsignificant increase of 70 ft (95% CI, 267 to -127, P = .48). Treatment as usual group significantly decreased by 205 ft (95% CI, -35 to -374, P = .02) and no group differences occurred over time in end-systolic volume (P = .43) and left ventricular function (LVEF) (P = .67). However, groups differed over time in the Beck Depression Inventory (F = 9.2, P < .01). Both TC and RB groups improved (decreased) by 3.5 points (95% CI, 2-5, P < .01). Treatment as usual group decreased insignificantly 1 point (95% CI, -1 to 3, P = .27).
Tai chi and RB participants avoided a decrease in physical function decrements as seen with TAU. No groups changed in cardiac function.

31373956,Chiang et al.,Active Physical Activity Patterns Are Associated With Improved Quality of Life and Depression Status in Taiwanese Women With Metabolic Syndrome.,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS), health-related quality of life (HRQL), and depression status are independently associated with cardiac health. Therefore, understanding the associations between MetS, HRQL, and depression status and determining factors related to improved HRQL and depression status in people with MetS may help in cardiovascular disease prevention.
The aim of this study was to examine whether there are differences in HRQL and depression status between Taiwanese women with and without MetS and whether physical activity patterns are associated with HRQL and depression status in this population.
A cross-sectional study of 326 Taiwanese middle-aged and older women (≥40 years) was conducted. Metabolic syndrome was determined based on the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III definition. Health-related quality of life and depression status were collected using the Short Form 36 Health Survey and Beck Depression Inventory. Univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were conducted.
Women with MetS had lower HRQL (P < .001) and higher depression status (P = .002) than those without MetS. Participants with active physical activity patterns had higher HRQL (P < .001) and lower depression status (P = .046) than those with sedentary patterns. Among women with MetS, those with active physical activity patterns had higher HRQL (P = .001) and lower depression status (P = .007) than those with sedentary patterns.
Metabolic syndrome is related to lower HRQL and higher depression status in women 40 years and older. Active physical activity patterns are associated with better HRQL and reduced depression status in middle-aged and older women (≥40 years) with MetS.",[],The Journal of cardiovascular nursing,10.1097/JCN.0000000000000602,2019-08-03,"[{'lastname': 'Chiang', 'firstname': 'Li-Chi', 'initials': 'LC', 'affiliation': 'Li-Chi Chiang, PhD, RN Professor, School of Nursing, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei; and School of Nursing, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC.

31290261,Nóbrega-Sousa et al.,Usual walking and obstacle avoidance are influenced by depressive and anxiety symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease.,"The aim of the present study was to analyze the association of depressive and anxiety symptoms with usual walking and obstacle avoidance in patients with Parkinson's disease.
Patients were divided into three groups: without depressive and anxiety symptoms (n = 28); depressive symptoms only (n = 15); and depressive and anxiety symptoms (n = 19). Symptoms of depression and anxiety were evaluated by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale. Participants walked across a pathway in two experimental conditions: usual walking and obstacle avoidance. Kinematic data were recorded using an optoelectronic three-dimensional system.
During usual walking, the depressive and anxiety symptoms group presented shorter stride length and longer double support phase compared with the without depressive and anxiety symptoms group, and lower velocity than the without depressive and anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms groups. During the approach phase of obstacle avoidance, the depressive and anxiety symptoms group decreased the stride length and velocity, whereas the without depressive and anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms groups did not modulate these parameters. The depressive and anxiety symptoms group also showed shorter step length and velocity, longer step duration, and wider step width during obstacle crossing. Additionally, the depressive and anxiety symptoms group presented shorter foot-to-obstacle horizontal distances, and lower horizontal mean velocities during obstacle crossing. Partial correlation analyses showed that both depressive and anxiety symptoms were associated with spatiotemporal gait parameters.
Combined symptoms of depression and anxiety are associated with walking impairments in patients with Parkinson's disease in both usual walking and obstacle avoidance.

31248586,van der Zee-Neuen et al.,"The association of physical activity and depression in patients with, or at risk of, osteoarthritis is captured equally well by patient reported outcomes (PROs) and accelerometer measurements - Analyses of data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative.","Osteoarthritis (OA) patients are at increased risk of depression, and low levels of physical activity (PA) are a potential warning sign of depression. PA can be estimated by patient reported outcomes (PROs) or measured with accelerometers (ACCs). We explored which of these two best captures depression in patients with, or at risk of, OA.
48-months data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative were cross-sectionally analysed. The dichotomized Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale score was used as outcome (depression y/n). The Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) was selected as PRO. ACC-data comprised average minutes of daily moderate to vigorous activity. Two multivariable models (PRO-model/ACC-model) were compared directly and indirectly using areas under the curve (AUC) for the predicted probability of depression, penalized model selection criteria (PMSC) and log-likelihood ratio tests.
AUCs from the ACC (0.71 [95% CI 0.67; 0.75]) and PRO model (0.72 [95% CI 0.68; 0.76]) were not significantly different (p = 0.28). Differences in PMSC were small (<10). The log-likelihood ratio test for the comparison of the ACC (ll -505.22) with the base model (ll -505.98) was not significant (LR chi
PRO and ACC data perform similarly in capturing depression. Indirect comparison even pleads for PROs. Costs of accelerometers and the additional burden for patients are in support of the PASE as an appropriate alternative to screen for depression in OA patients.","['Co-morbidity', 'Depression', 'Osteoarthritis', 'Patient reported outcomes', 'Physical activity']",Seminars in arthritis and rheumatism,10.1016/j.semarthrit.2019.05.009,2019-06-30,"[{'lastname': 'van der Zee-Neuen', 'firstname': 'Antje', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Paracelsus Medical University, Institute of Nursing Science and Practice, Salzburg, Austria.

31155542,Fukunaga et al.,Prospective Study on the Association Between Adherence to Healthy Lifestyles and Depressive Symptoms Among Japanese Employees: The Furukawa Nutrition and Health Study.,"While a growing body of research suggests a protective role of healthy lifestyle against depression, evidence from prospective studies is scarce. We constructed a healthy lifestyle index (HLI) and examined its prospective association with depressive symptoms in a Japanese working population.
Participants were 917 employees (19-68 years old) who were free from depressive symptoms at baseline in 2012-2013 and attended the 3-year follow-up survey. The HLI (range: 0-7 points) was constructed by assigning 1 point to each healthy lifestyle factor, namely, (1) normal body mass index (18.5-24.9 kg/m
A total of 155 incident cases (17.0%) of depressive symptoms were identified at the follow-up survey. Compared with the low HLI group, multivariable-adjusted odds ratios of depressive symptoms were 0.74 (95% confidence interval, 0.48-1.15) and 0.55 (95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.99) for the middle and high HLI groups, respectively (P-trend = 0.041).
The present study suggests the importance of adherence to multiple healthy lifestyle factors in prevention of depressive symptoms.","['Japan', 'depression', 'lifestyle factors', 'prospective studies']",Journal of epidemiology,"10.2188/jea.JE20190018

31154459,Hur et al.,Impact of Psychological Deficits and Pain on Physical Activity of Patients with Interstitial Lung Disease.,"The impact of psychological deficits and pain on physical activity has not been adequately studied in patients with fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD). We aimed to determine the association of depression, anxiety, sleep quality, and pain with physical activity in fibrotic ILD.
Waist ActiGraph activity monitors were worn for seven consecutive days to track step counts and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) minutes at baseline and 6-month follow-up. Psychological deficits and pain were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the Brief Pain Inventory. Multivariable linear regression was used to determine if each deficit independently predicted physical activity when adjusted for potential confounders.
A total of 111 patients were recruited, with 91 of these patients completing the 6-month follow-up. Median step count and MVPA minutes were 3853 steps/day (interquartile range 2236-6805) and 87 (17-225) min/week at baseline, respectively, with no significant changes at follow-up. Borderline or abnormal depression and anxiety scores were present in 19% and 22% of patients, respectively. Poor sleep quality and moderate-to-severe pain were present in 61% and 9% of patients. Higher depression scores were associated with fewer baseline and follow-up step counts and lower MVPA minutes at follow-up on unadjusted analysis; higher pain severity scores were associated with fewer baseline step count. Pain severity remained an independent predictor of reduced step count after adjusting for patient's age, smoking status, ILD severity, and weather variables.
Pain severity may be a potentially modifiable determinant of physical activity in patients with fibrotic ILD.","['Accelerometry', 'Depression', 'Exercise', 'Interstitial lung disease', 'Pain', 'Questionnaires', 'Surveys']",Lung,10.1007/s00408-019-00242-3,2019-06-04,"[{'lastname': 'Hur', 'firstname': 'Seo Am', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': ""Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, 8B Providence, 1081 Burrard Street, Vancouver, BC, V6Z 1Y6, Canada.\nCentre for Heart Lung Innovation, St. Paul'S Hospital, Vancouver, BC, V6Z 1Y6, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Guler', 'firstname': 'Sabina A', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': ""Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, 8B Providence, 1081 Burrard Street, Vancouver, BC, V6Z 1Y6, Canada.\nCentre for Heart Lung Innovation, St. Paul'S Hospital, Vancouver, BC, V6Z 1Y6, Canada.\nDepartment of Pulmonary Medicine, University Hospital and University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.""}, {'lastname': 'Khalil', 'firstname': 'Nasreen', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'The Lung Centre, Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, BC, V5Z 1M9, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Camp', 'firstname': 'Pat G', 'initials': 'PG', 'affiliation': ""Centre for Heart Lung Innovation, St. Paul'S Hospital, Vancouver, BC, V6Z 1Y6, Canada.\nDepartment of Physical Therapy, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, V6T 1Z4, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Guenette', 'firstname': 'Jordan A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': ""Centre for Heart Lung Innovation, St. Paul'S Hospital, Vancouver, BC, V6Z 1Y6, Canada.\nDepartment of Physical Therapy, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, V6T 1Z4, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Ryerson', 'firstname': 'Christopher J', 'initials': 'CJ', 'affiliation': ""Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, 8B Providence, 1081 Burrard Street, Vancouver, BC, V6Z 1Y6, Canada. chris.ryerson@hli.ubc.ca.\nCentre for Heart Lung Innovation, St. Paul'S Hospital, Vancouver, BC, V6Z 1Y6, Canada. chris.ryerson@hli.ubc.ca.""}]","31154459

31085217,Frank et al.,Systemic low-grade inflammation and subsequent depressive symptoms: Is there a mediating role of physical activity?,"Systemic low-grade inflammation has been associated with the onset of depression, but the exact mechanisms underlying this relationship remain elusive. This study examined whether physical activity (PA) explained the association between elevated serum levels of inflammatory markers and subsequent depressive symptoms.
Prospective cohort design.
The sample consisted of 3809 non-depressed men and women (aged 50+) recruited from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). Serum levels of inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen) and covariates (age, sex, education, wealth, body mass index, smoking, cholesterol, triglycerides) were measured at baseline (wave 4, 2008/09). Self-reported weekly moderate/vigorous (high) PA versus no weekly moderate/vigorous (low) PA was examined at a four-year follow-up (wave 6, 2012/13), using a single-item question. Depressive symptoms were assessed at baseline, four years (wave 6, 2012/13) and six years post baseline (wave 7, 2014/15), using the 8-item version of the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D).
Participants with higher baseline concentrations of inflammatory markers were significantly more likely to report low PA levels four years later (CRP: OR: 1.25; 95% CI, 1.05-1.48; fibrinogen: OR: 1.18; 95% CI, 1.05-1.39). Moreover, low PA was associated with higher odds of elevated depressive symptoms at follow-up (OR: 1.59; 95% CI, 1.15-2.19). Mediation analyses revealed that low PA explained a total of 36.71% of the relationship between high CRP and elevated depressive symptoms, and 33.26% between higher levels of fibrinogen and elevated depressive symptoms six years later. No direct association was found between systemic low-grade inflammation and future depressive symptoms.
These results suggest that low PA is a significant partial mediator of the relationship between systemic low-grade inflammation and subsequent elevated depressive symptoms in a nationally representative cohort of older adults.","['Depressive symptoms', 'Mediation analysis', 'Physical activity', 'Systemic low-grade inflammation']","Brain, behavior, and immunity",10.1016/j.bbi.2019.05.017,2019-05-16,"[{'lastname': 'Frank', 'firstname': 'Philipp', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London, 1-19 Torrington Place, WC1E 7HB, London, UK.

31083052,Smagula et al.,Moderators of Response to Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Major Depression in Patients With Heart Failure.,"Although cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is efficacious for major depression in patients with heart failure (HF), approximately half of patients do not remit after CBT. To identify treatment moderators that may help guide treatment allocation strategies and serve as new treatment targets, we performed a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial. Based on evidence of their prognostic relevance, we evaluated whether clinical and activity characteristics moderate the effects of CBT.
Participants were randomized to enhanced usual care (UC) alone or CBT plus enhanced UC. The single-blinded outcomes were 6-month changes in Beck Depression Inventory total scores and remission (defined as a Beck Depression Inventory ≤ 9). Actigraphy was used to assess daily physical activity patterns. We performed analyses to identify the specific activity and clinical moderators of the effects of CBT in 94 adults (mean age = 58, 49% female) with HF and major depressive disorder.
Patients benefited more from CBT (versus UC) if they had the following: more medically severe HF (i.e., a higher New York Heart Association class or a lower left ventricular ejection fraction), more stable activity patterns, wider active periods, and later evening settling times. These individual moderator effects were small (|r| = 0.10-0.21), but combining the moderators yielded a medium moderator effect size (r = 0.38; 95% CI = 0.20-0.52).
These findings suggest that increasing the cross-daily stability of activity patterns, and prolonging the daily active period, might help increase the efficacy of CBT. Given moderating effects of HF severity measures, research is also needed to clarify and address factors in patients with less severe HF that diminish the efficacy of CBT.

30994779,de Oliveira et al.,"The effects of physical activity on anxiety, depression, and quality of life in elderly people living in the community.","Health problems may negatively affect the psychological and physical aspects of life, influencing the quality of life of older adults. The objective of this study was to analyze the effects of physical activity on quality of life, anxiety, and depression in the elderly population.
We performed a cross-sectional study of 200 elderly people of both genders. Subjects were divided into two groups: one with 100 senior citizens engaged in physical activities in a social center for the elderly; and another composed of 100 subjects who lived in the community but were not engaged in physical activities. The instruments used to assess physical activities, quality of life, and anxiety and depression were, respectively: the modified Baecke questionnaire; the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36); and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The data were analyzed using the Student's t test, Pearson's r, and analysis of variance (ANOVA), with odds ratio and a 5% significance level (p<0.05).
We observed that the active group showed higher scores of physical activity and quality of life. Conversely, the sedentary group revealed higher scores of anxiety and depression. Data assessment revealed a strong correlation between the domains quality of life, level of vitality, and mental health (r=0.77). The prevalence ratio showed that physical activity is a protective factor against anxiety and depression in the elderly.
The findings suggest a correlation between low levels of physical activity and symptoms of anxiety and depression in the elderly living in the community.",[],Trends in psychiatry and psychotherapy,10.1590/2237-6089-2017-0129,2019-04-18,"[{'lastname': 'de Oliveira', 'firstname': 'Lucineide da Silva Santos Castelo Branco', 'initials': 'LDSSCB', 'affiliation': 'Secretaria Estadual de Saúde do Estado de Mato Grosso, Cuiabá, MT, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Souza', 'firstname': 'Edila C', 'initials': 'EC', 'affiliation': 'Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso (UFMT), Cuiabá, MT, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Rodrigues', 'firstname': 'Rosilene Andrade Silva', 'initials': 'RAS', 'affiliation': 'Secretaria Estadual de Saúde do Estado de Mato Grosso, Cuiabá, MT, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Fett', 'firstname': 'Carlos Alexandre', 'initials': 'CA', 'affiliation': 'Núcleo de Aptidão Física, Informática, Metabolismo, Esporte e Saúde (NAFIMES), UFMT, Cuiabá, MT, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Piva', 'firstname': 'Angelo Biagini', 'initials': 'AB', 'affiliation': 'Universidade Federal de Uberlândia (UFU), Uberlândia, MG, Brazil.'}]",30994779,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Trends Psychiatry Psychother"""
30958884,Walter et al.,Depressive Symptoms are Associated with Heart Rate Variability Independently of Fitness: A Cross-Sectional Study of Patients with Heart Failure.,"Depression is associated with reduced heart rate variability (HRV) in healthy and cardiac samples, which may be accounted for by physical fitness. In a small sample of cardiac patients, activity and fitness levels attenuated the relationship between HRV and depression. In the current study of heart failure (HF) patients, we hypothesized that depressive symptoms and HRV would be inversely related and physical fitness would attenuate this association.
To determine if previous associations among depressive symptoms, physical fitness, and HRV would replicate in a sample of HF patients.
The sample consisted of HF patients (N = 125) aged 68.55 ± 8.92 years, 68.8% male, and 83.2% Caucasian. The study was cross-sectional and a secondary analysis of a nonrandomized clinical trial (Trial Identifier: NCT00871897). Depressive symptoms were evaluated using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)-II, fitness with the 2 min step test (2MST), and HRV during a 10 min resting laboratory psychophysiology protocol. The dependent variable in hierarchical linear regressions was the root mean square of successive differences.
Controlling for sex, age, β-blocker use, hypertension, and diabetes, higher BDI-II scores significantly predicted lower HRV, β = -.29, t(92) = -2.79, p < .01. Adding 2MST did not attenuate the relationship in a follow-up regression.
Depressive symptoms were associated with lower HRV in HF patients, independent of physical fitness. Given the prevalence of depression and suppressed HRV common among HF patients, interventions addressing depressive symptoms and other predictors of poor outcomes may be warranted.","['Depression', 'Fitness', 'Heart failure', 'Heart rate variability']",Annals of behavioral medicine : a publication of the Society of Behavioral Medicine,10.1093/abm/kaz006,2019-04-09,"[{'lastname': 'Walter', 'firstname': 'Fawn A', 'initials': 'FA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychological Sciences, Kent State University, Kent, OH, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Gathright', 'firstname': 'Emily', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, The Miriam Hospital and Alpert School of Medicine at Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Redle', 'firstname': 'Joseph D', 'initials': 'JD', 'affiliation': 'Summa Health Systems, Cardiovascular Institute, Akron City Hospital, Akron, OH, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Gunstad', 'firstname': 'John', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychological Sciences, Kent State University, Kent, OH, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hughes', 'firstname': 'Joel W', 'initials': 'JW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychological Sciences, Kent State University, Kent, OH, USA.'}]","30958884

30958514,Kwok et al.,Effects of Mindfulness Yoga vs Stretching and Resistance Training Exercises on Anxiety and Depression for People With Parkinson Disease: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Clinical practice guidelines support exercise for patients with Parkinson disease (PD), but to our knowledge, no randomized clinical trials have tested whether yoga is superior to conventional physical exercises for stress and symptom management.
To compare the effects of a mindfulness yoga program vs stretching and resistance training exercise (SRTE) on psychological distress, physical health, spiritual well-being, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with mild-to-moderate PD.
An assessor-masked, randomized clinical trial using the intention-to-treat principle was conducted at 4 community rehabilitation centers in Hong Kong between December 1, 2016, and May 31, 2017. A total of 187 adults (aged ≥18 years) with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic PD who were able to stand unaided and walk with or without an assistive device were enrolled via convenience sampling. Eligible participants were randomized 1:1 to mindfulness yoga or SRTE.
Mindfulness yoga was delivered in 90-minute groups and SRTE were delivered in 60-minute groups for 8 weeks.
Primary outcomes included anxiety and depressive symptoms assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Secondary outcomes included severity of motor symptoms (Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [MDS-UPDRS], Part III motor score), mobility, spiritual well-being in terms of perceived hardship and equanimity, and HRQOL. Assessments were done at baseline, 8 weeks (T1), and 20 weeks (T2).
The 138 participants included 65 men (47.1%) with a mean (SD) age of 63.7 (8.7) years and a mean (SD) MDS-UPDRS score of 33.3 (15.3). Generalized estimating equation analyses revealed that the yoga group had significantly better improvement in outcomes than the SRTE group, particularly for anxiety (time-by-group interaction, T1: β, -1.79 [95% CI, -2.85 to -0.69; P = .001]; T2: β, -2.05 [95% CI, -3.02 to -1.08; P < .001]), depression (T1: β, -2.75 [95% CI, -3.17 to -1.35; P < .001]); T2: β, -2.75 [95% CI, -3.71 to -1.79; P < .001]), perceived hardship (T1: β, -0.92 [95% CI, -1.25 to -0.61; P < .001]; T2: β, -0.76 [95% CI, -1.12 to -0.40; P < .001]), perceived equanimity (T1: β, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.79-1.42; P < .001]; T2: β, 1.19 [95% CI, 0.82-1.56; P < .001]), and disease-specific HRQOL (T1: β, -7.77 [95% CI, -11.61 to -4.38; P < .001]; T2: β, -7.99 [95% CI, -11.61 to -4.38; P < .001]).
Among patients with mild-to-moderate PD, the mindfulness yoga program was found to be as effective as SRTE in improving motor dysfunction and mobility, with the additional benefits of a reduction in anxiety and depressive symptoms and an increase in spiritual well-being and HRQOL.

30938078,Nah et al.,"Relationships between illness representations, physical activity and depression in chronic kidney disease.","Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is exacerbated by depression and confers significant healthcare costs. Whilst adverse impacts may be mitigated by physical activity, many patients with CKD remain physically inactive, with this physical inactivity potentially influenced by how CKD is appraised.
The study aims to explore the relationship between physical activity, depression and illness representations in CKD.
Patients with CKD but not requiring dialysis completed the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and Short-Form International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-SF). Demographic information was obtained via medical records. Correlation and regression analyses were conducted to determine the relationship of illness representations with levels of physical activity. Moderation and mediation analyses were performed to investigate the role of depression in any relationship between illness representations and physical activity levels.
Seventy respondents, 60 % male, with a mean age of 60 ± 16 years, took part in the study. Of illness representation dimensions, personal control was positively associated with levels of physical activity whilst timeline cyclical (a subscale of the IPQ-R relating to patient beliefs about the nature of their illness) was a significant predictor. Severity of depression was neither a moderator nor a mediator of illness representations and levels of physical activity.
Facets of illness representations had significant relationships with levels of physical activity. Future research concerning the development and validation of psychological interventions based on an illness representations framework for patients with CKD not requiring dialysis is proposed. The efficacy of such interventions could be then evaluated using a randomised controlled method.","['Chronic kidney disease', 'Depression', 'Illness perceptions', 'Illness representations', 'Physical activity']",Journal of renal care,10.1111/jorc.12274,2019-04-03,"[{'lastname': 'Nah', 'firstname': 'Ryan', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience, Psychology and Behaviour, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Robertson', 'firstname': 'Noelle', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'School of Sports Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University, Loughborough, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Niyi-Odumosu', 'firstname': 'Faatihah A', 'initials': 'FA', 'affiliation': 'Leicester Kidney Lifestyle Team, John Walls Renal Unit, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust and Department of Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Clarke', 'firstname': 'Amy L', 'initials': 'AL', 'affiliation': 'School of Sports Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University, Loughborough, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Bishop', 'firstname': 'Nicolette C', 'initials': 'NC', 'affiliation': 'Leicester Kidney Lifestyle Team, John Walls Renal Unit, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust and Department of Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'Alice C', 'initials': 'AC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience, Psychology and Behaviour, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.'}]",30938078,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""J Ren Care"""
30808333,Allabadi et al.,Depression and anxiety symptoms in cardiac patients: a cross-sectional hospital-based study in a Palestinian population.,"Mental health problems have an adverse effect on the course of cardiac disease. The integration of their diagnosis and treatment into cardiology care is generally poor. It is particularly challenging in cultural environments where mental health problems are stigmatized. The objective of the current study was to investigate the proportion of cardiac patients with depression and anxiety as well as factors associated with the presence of these symptoms in a Palestinian population.
This cross-sectional hospital-based study was conducted on patients consecutively admitted with a new or existing cardiac diagnosis to one of the four main hospitals in Nablus, Palestine over an eight-month period. Data was obtained from hospital medical charts and an in-person interview, using a structured questionnaire with a sequence of validated instruments. All subjects were screened for depression and anxiety using the Cardiac Depression Scale (CDS) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-42). Multivariate ordered logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors among four categories (socio-demographic, clinical, psychosocial, lifestyle) independently associated with depression and anxiety.
In total, 1053 patients with a confirmed cardiac diagnosis were included in the study with a participation rate of 96%. Based on the CDS and DASS-42, 54% met the criteria for severe depression (CDS > 100) and 19.2% for severe-to-very severe anxiety (DASS-anxiety > 15), respectively. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were more prevalent among females and less educated patients. Factors independently associated with both depressive and anxiety symptoms were post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, low level of self-esteem, high somatic symptoms, low physical and mental health component scores, active smoking, physical inactivity, and longer disease duration. Patients with depressive and anxiety symptoms also reported poor social support and lower resilience.
There was a high level of depression and anxiety in this sample of cardiac patients. The results point to characteristics of patients in particular need for mental health screening and suggest possible targets for intervention such as strengthening of social support and of physical activity. The integration of mental health services into cardiac rehabilitation in Palestine and comparable cultural settings is warranted from the time of first diagnosis and onward.","['Anxiety', 'Cardiac rehabilitation', 'Cardiovascular diseases', 'Depression', 'Predictors', 'Prevalence']",BMC public health,"10.1186/s12889-019-6561-3

30719583,"Sivaramakrishnan, Madhavan",Recumbent stepping aerobic exercise in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a pilot study.,"Aerobic exercise can promote neuroplastic responses in the healthy and injured brain. Although the role of exercise in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is debated, new evidence suggests that exercise may reduce disease progression. While common exercise modalities such as the treadmill and cycle ergometer have been explored in ALS, the safety and feasibility of a total body recumbent stepper have not been investigated. Additionally, the functional and neurophysiological effects of recumbent stepping in ALS are still unknown. Here, we investigated the safety and feasibility of a 4-week recumbent stepping program to slow disease progression in ALS and possibly facilitate neuroplasticity.
Nine individuals with ALS performed moderate intensity recumbent stepping for four weeks. Outcomes included participation satisfaction questionnaire, ALS Functional Rating Scale Revised (ALSFRS-R), clinical tests of walking and endurance, fatigue severity scale, Beck depression inventory, SF-12, and transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced motor evoked potentials (MEPs). All measurements were collected at baseline, post-intervention, and at the 1-month follow-up.
Eight participants completed the study without any adverse events. The ALSFRS-R scores were similar at the end of the study and at follow-up. No significant differences were noted for any of the clinical outcomes. MEPs were present only in two participants and changes in corticomotor excitability after exercise were minimal.
Results from this preliminary study support the safety and feasibility of 12 sessions of total body recumbent stepping in individuals with ALS.","['ALSFRS-R', 'Aerobic exercise', 'Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'Corticomotor excitability', 'Neuroplasticity', 'Recumbent stepping']",Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,"10.1007/s10072-019-03736-3

30685529,"Bedillion, Ansell, Thomas",Cancer treatment effects on cognition and depression: The moderating role of physical activity.,"Breast cancer survivors report significant cognitive impairments post treatment, particularly following chemotherapy. Depression may also occur post treatment and may partially mediate the effects of cancer treatment on cognition. Additionally, physical activity has been shown to mitigate treatment effects on cognition and depression. This study examined the role of depression in mediating the effects of cancer treatment on cognitive function (perceived cognitive impairment, PCI; perceived cognitive ability, PCA) in breast cancer survivors and explored the role of physical activity in moderating these effects.
317 breast cancer survivors were recruited via Army of Women. Participants were 40-75 years old and had stage 0 (in situ) to IIIc breast cancer and were less than 10 years post treatment. Participants completed a demographic and treatment questionnaire, as well as the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function, and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale.
Depressive symptoms significantly contributed to cognitive function in all models. Moderate and vigorous levels of physical activity moderated breast cancer treatment effects on depression and cognition. Chemotherapy, tamoxifen, and anastrozole all demonstrated negative effects on cognition.
The results from this study support the importance of examining mediating factors in the effects of cancer treatment on cognition, particularly depression, following cancer treatment. Effects of treatment on cognition in breast cancer survivors are partially explained by changes in depressive symptoms, although chemotherapy may impact cognition independent of depression. Importantly, physical activity may reduce the risk of depression and cognitive impairment in breast cancer survivors.","['Breast cancer', 'Cancer treatment', 'Cognition', 'Depression', 'Physical activity']","Breast (Edinburgh, Scotland)",10.1016/j.breast.2019.01.004,2019-01-28,"[{'lastname': 'Bedillion', 'firstname': 'Margaret F', 'initials': 'MF', 'affiliation': ""Department of Exercise Science, 201 Women's Building, Syracuse University, USA.

30665505,Paine et al.,Psychological distress is related to poor health behaviours in COPD and non-COPD patients: Evidence from the CanCOLD study.,"Patients with psychiatric disorders (depression, anxiety) are more likely to have poor health behaviours, including higher smoking and lower physical activity (PA) levels. Smoking is a major risk factor for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and PA is critical for COPD management. However, no studies have assessed associations between psychological distress and these behaviours among patients with vs without COPD. This is a sub-analysis of the CanCOLD study that assessed the relationships between psychological disorders (depression, anxiety) and poor health behaviours (smoking, PA).
717 COPD and 797 matched non-COPD individuals from the CanCOLD study, completed the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) to assess anxiety and depression. Smoking behaviour was self-reported pack-years smoking. The CHAMPS PA questionnaire determined calorific expenditure as a PA measure. Regressions determined relationships between anxiety/depression and health behaviours, adjusting for age, sex, BMI, GOLD stage and COPD status.
Across the whole sample, we observed relationships between depression (β = 1.107 ± 0.197; 95%CI = 0.691-1.462; p < .001) and anxiety (β = 0.780 ± 0.170; 95%CI = 0.446-1.114; p < .001) and pack years. Higher depression (β = -0.220 ± 0.028; 95%CI = -0.275 to -0.165; p < .001) and anxiety (β = -0.091 ± 0.025; 95%CI = -0.139 to -0.043; p < .001) scores were related to lower PA. These associations were comparable across COPD and non-COPD patients.
Results showed that higher levels of anxiety and depression were related to higher cumulative smoking and lower levels of PA in patients with and without COPD, suggesting symptoms of psychological distress is similarly associated with poorer health behaviours in COPD and non-COPD individuals. Future studies need to determine if treating symptoms of psychological distress can improve health behaviours and outcomes in this population.","['Anxiety', 'COPD', 'CanCOLD', 'Depression', 'Physical activity', 'Smoking']",Respiratory medicine,10.1016/j.rmed.2018.11.006,2019-01-23,"[{'lastname': 'Paine', 'firstname': 'Nicola J', 'initials': 'NJ', 'affiliation': ""School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University, Loughborough, United Kingdom; Montréal Behavioural Medicine Centre, Centre intégrée universitaire de services de santé et de services sociaux du Nord-de-l'Île-de-Montréal, Hôpital du Sacré-Coeur de Montréal, 5400 Boulevard Gouin Ouest, Montréal, Québec, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Bacon', 'firstname': 'Simon L', 'initials': 'SL', 'affiliation': ""Montréal Behavioural Medicine Centre, Centre intégrée universitaire de services de santé et de services sociaux du Nord-de-l'Île-de-Montréal, Hôpital du Sacré-Coeur de Montréal, 5400 Boulevard Gouin Ouest, Montréal, Québec, Canada; Department of Exercise Science, Concordia University, Montréal, Québec, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Bourbeau', 'firstname': 'Jean', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Respiratory Epidemiology and Clinical Research Unit, Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Tan', 'firstname': 'Wan C', 'initials': 'WC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Lavoie', 'firstname': 'Kim L', 'initials': 'KL', 'affiliation': ""Montréal Behavioural Medicine Centre, Centre intégrée universitaire de services de santé et de services sociaux du Nord-de-l'Île-de-Montréal, Hôpital du Sacré-Coeur de Montréal, 5400 Boulevard Gouin Ouest, Montréal, Québec, Canada; Department of Psychology, University of Québec at Montréal, Montréal, Québec, Canada.

30646198,Coll et al.,Efficacy of Regular Exercise During Pregnancy on the Prevention of Postpartum Depression: The PAMELA Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Interventions to reduce postpartum depression have mainly focused on enhancing screening to increase treatment rates among women. Preventive approaches are timely from a population health perspective, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where access to mental health services is limited.
To assess the efficacy of regular exercise during pregnancy on the prevention of postpartum depression.
This randomized clinical trial examines a prespecified secondary outcome of the Physical Activity for Mothers Enrolled in Longitudinal Analysis (PAMELA) Study, a parallel-group, randomized clinical trial. This trial was nested in the 2015 Pelotas (Brazil) Birth Cohort Study. Between August 27, 2014, and March 14, 2016, pregnant women between 16 and 20 weeks of gestation with no contraindications to exercise were randomized 1:2 to the intervention group or control group via computer-generated randomization using a block size of 9. Data were analyzed from March 7 to May 2, 2018.
Participants assigned to the intervention were engaged in a 16-week supervised exercise program including aerobic and resistance training delivered in 60-minute sessions 3 times per week.
Postpartum depressive symptoms were assessed with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale 3 months after birth. A score of 12 or greater was defined as screening positive for postpartum depression. Primary analysis was performed on a complete case basis (90% of participants who had the primary end point ascertained).
A total of 639 participants (mean [SD] age, 27.1 [5.1] years; mean gestational age, 16.5 [1.5] weeks) were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n = 213) or control group (n = 426). Compliance with the protocol, defined as having engaged in at least 70% of exercise sessions, was low (40.4%). There was no significant difference in mean (SD) scores for postpartum depression between the intervention group (4.8 [3.7]) and the control group (5.4 [4.1]) (mean difference, -0.6; 95% CI, -1.3 to 0.1). There was also no significant difference in rates of postpartum depression between the intervention group (12 of 192 [6.3%]) and the control group (36 of 387 [9.3%]) (odds ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.33-1.28). Instrumental variable analysis indicated that noncompliance may have attenuated the effect estimates obtained in the primary analysis.
Moderate-intensity exercise during pregnancy did not lead to significant reductions in postpartum depression. However, noncompliance to the intervention protocol was substantial and may have led to underestimations of the possible benefits of exercise. The point estimates for this study are in the same direction as the previous randomized clinical trial on this topic. Future studies on how to promote regular exercise during pregnancy to improve compliance, particularly targeting young and less educated women, are warranted before further trials are undertaken.

30642326,López-Torres Hidalgo,Effectiveness of physical exercise in the treatment of depression in older adults as an alternative to antidepressant drugs in primary care.,"Although currently available evidence suggests that physical exercise can be beneficial for depressed patients and might be comparable to antidepressant treatment, the best way of implementing this recommendation in clinical practice is not known. This study therefore aims to ascertain the non-inferiority of supervised physical exercise to antidepressant drug treatment, in terms of reducing depressive symptoms among patients presenting with clinical criteria of a depressive episode (ICD-10), across a follow-up period of 6 months.
It will take the form of a randomised clinical trial undertaken in a primary care setting, in which a total of 312 patients over the age of 65 years with clinically significant depression will be randomly assigned to supervised physical exercise programme, or will alternatively receive treatment with antidepressant drugs habitually used in clinical practice. Participants' physical condition will be assessed at baseline, and again at 15 days and 1, 3 and 6 months. The supervised exercise programme will consist of 2 weekly sessions in groups of 10-12 patients across a period of 6 months, in which a sports instructor will train patients to do at least 30 min of regular activity at moderate intensity on an almost daily basis, including aerobic, muscle-strengthening, flexibility, and balance-strengthening exercises. The following will be assessed at regular intervals in both groups: status of depression symptoms; level of physical activity; self-perceived health status; appearance of adverse effects; and adherence to the physical exercise programme or antidepressant treatment. The principal outcome variable will be a reduction in pre-treatment depression-symptom scale scores (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and Geriatric Depression Scale).
In terms of the number of patients and duration of follow-up, this proposed clinical trial is a project which easily surpasses the few studies on this subject that have been previously conducted on the elderly. Its aim is to provide solid scientific evidence on a therapeutic resource -physical exercise- which has undeniable health benefits and can be applied to certain health problems, such as depressive disorders, which are of great magnitude and considerable socio-economic relevance, and have a significant impact on the quality of life of older adults.

30635439,Courtin et al.,"Long-term effects of compulsory schooling on physical, mental and cognitive ageing: a natural experiment.","Longer schooling is associated with better physical, mental and cognitive functioning, but there is controversy as to whether these associations are causal. We examine the long-term health impact of a policy that increased compulsory schooling by 2 years in France for cohorts born on or after January 1953, offering a natural experiment.
Data came from Constances, a randomly selected cohort of the French population assessed for cognition, depressive symptoms and physical functioning at ages 45 and older (n=18 929). We use a Regression Discontinuity Design to estimate the impact of increased schooling duration on health. Cognition was measured based on five validated neuropsychological tests and combined into an overall score. The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale was used to assess depressive symptoms levels. Physical functioning was included as finger tapping, hand grip strength and walking speed.
The reform increased average schooling, particularly among participants from disadvantaged families. Estimates suggest that for men, this reform improved cognitive scores (β=0.15, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.27), but had no impact on physical functioning. Among women, the reform did not increase cognitive scores or physical functioning but led to higher levels of depressive symptoms (β=1.52, 95% CI 0.32 to 2.72). Results were robust to a range of sensitivity analyses.
These findings highlight the need to carefully consider the potential limits of policies that increase the length of compulsory schooling as strategies to improve population health.","['depression', 'education', 'health inequalities', 'policy', 'social epidemiology']",Journal of epidemiology and community health,"10.1136/jech-2018-211746

30560742,"Fancourt, Tymoszuk",Cultural engagement and incident depression in older adults: evidence from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing.,"There is a recognised need for the identification of factors that might be protective against the development of depression in older adults. Over the past decade, there has been growing research demonstrating the effects of cultural engagement (which combines a number of protective factors including social interaction, cognitive stimulation and gentle physical activity) on the treatment of depression, but as yet not on its prevention.AimsTo explore whether cultural engagement in older adults is associated with a reduced risk of developing depression over the following decade.
Working with data from 2148 adults in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing who were free from depression at baseline, we used logistic regression models to explore associations between frequency of cultural engagement (including going to museums, theatre and cinema) and the risk of developing depression over the following 10 years using a combined index of the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and physician-diagnosed depression.
There was a dose-response relationship between frequency of cultural engagement and the risk of developing depression independent of sociodemographic, health-related and social confounders. This equated to a 32% lower risk of developing depression for people who attended every few months (odds ratio (OR) = 0.68, 95% CI 0.47-0.99, P = 0.046) and a 48% lower risk for people who attended once a month or more (OR = 0.52, 95% CI 0.34-0.80, P = 0.003). Results were robust to sensitivity analyses exploring reverse causality, subclinical depressive symptoms and alternative CES-D thresholds.
Cultural engagement appears to be an independent risk-reducing factor for the development of depression in older age.Declaration of interestNone.","['Depressive disorders', 'epidemiology', 'psychosocial interventions']",The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,10.1192/bjp.2018.267,2018-12-19,"[{'lastname': 'Fancourt', 'firstname': 'Daisy', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Wellcome Research Fellow,Department of Behavioural Science and Health,University College London,UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Tymoszuk', 'firstname': 'Urszula', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'Research Associate, Centre for Performance Science,Royal College of Music and Imperial College London; andResearch Department of Epidemiology and Public Health,University College London,UK.'}]","30560742

30543801,Rosenfeldt et al.,Combined Aerobic Exercise and Task Practice Improve Health-Related Quality of Life Poststroke: A Preliminary Analysis.,"The aim of this project was to determine the effects of lower extremity aerobic exercise coupled with upper extremity repetitive task practice (RTP) on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and depressive symptomology in individuals with chronic stroke.
Secondary analysis of data from 2 randomized controlled trials.
Research laboratory.
Individuals (N=40) with chronic stroke.
Participants received one of the following interventions: forced exercise+RTP (FE+RTP, n=16), voluntary exercise+RTP (VE+RTP, n=16), or stroke education+RTP (EDU+RTP, n=8). All groups completed 24 sessions, each session lasting 90 minutes.
The Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) and Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) were used to assess depressive symptomology and HRQOL.
There were no significant group-by-time interactions for any of the SIS domains or composite scores. Examining the individual groups following the intervention, those in the FE+RTP and VE+RTP groups demonstrated significant improvements in the following SIS domains: strength, mobility, hand function, activities of daily living, and the physical composite. In addition, the FE+RTP group demonstrated significant improvements in memory, cognitive composite, and percent recovery from stroke. The HRQOL did not change in the EDU+RTP group. Although CES-D scores improved predominantly for those in the FE+RTP group, these improvements were not statistically significant. Overall, results were maintained at the 4-week follow-up.
Aerobic exercise, regardless of mode, preceding motor task practice may improve HRQOL in patients with stroke. The potential of aerobic exercise to improve cardiorespiratory endurance, motor outcomes, and HRQOL poststroke justifies its use to augment traditional task practice.","['Aerobic exercise', 'Depression', 'Health-related quality of life', 'Rehabilitation', 'Stroke']",Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,10.1016/j.apmr.2018.11.011,2018-12-14,"[{'lastname': 'Rosenfeldt', 'firstname': 'Anson B', 'initials': 'AB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.'}, {'lastname': 'Linder', 'firstname': 'Susan M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH; Neurological Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.

30463527,von Berens et al.,Effect of exercise and nutritional supplementation on health-related quality of life and mood in older adults: the VIVE2 randomized controlled trial.,"Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and absence of depressive symptoms are of great importance for older people, which may be achieved through lifestyle interventions, e.g., exercise and nutrition interventions. The aim of this investigation was to analyze the effects of a physical activity program in combination with protein supplementation on HRQoL and depressive symptoms in community-dwelling, mobility-limited older adults.
In the Vitality, Independence, and Vigor 2 Study (VIVE2), community-dwelling men and women with an average age of 77.5 ± 5.4 years, some mobility limitations and low serum vitamin D levels (25(OH)Vit D 22.5-60 nmol/l) from two study sites (Stockholm, Sweden and Boston, USA) were randomized to receive a nutritional supplement or a placebo for 6 months. All took part in a physical activity program 2-3 times/ week. The primary outcome examined in VIVE2 was 400 M walk capacity. HRQoL was measured using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF36), consisting of the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS), and depressive symptoms were measured using The Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). In the sensitivity analyses, the sample was divided into sub-groups based on body measures and function (body mass index (BMI), appendicular lean mass index (ALMI), handgrip strength and gait speed).
For the whole sample, there was a significant improvement in both MCS, mean (95% CI) 2.68 (0.5, 4.9) (p 0.02), and CES-D -2.7 (- 4.5, - 0.9) (p 0.003) during the intervention, but no difference was detected between those who received the nutritional supplement and those who received the placebo. The results revealed no significant change in PCS or variation in effects across the sub-categories.
This study demonstrates that a six-month intervention using a physical activity program had positive effects on mental status. No additional effects from nutritional supplementation were detected.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a program of Ai Chi aquatic therapy on pain, depression and quality of life in people with Parkinson's disease. Participants were randomized to receive dry land physiotherapy treatment (control group) or aquatic Ai Chi sessions in the pool (experimental group). The outcome measures used included the VAS pain scale, the Geriatric Depression Scale and the SF-36 quality of life scale. In the experimental group treated with aquatic therapy, significant differences were found in the pain, depression and quality of life variables post-treatment (p < 0.001). In the control group, improvements were only observed in the VAS pain scale, and these were less significant than the changes found in the experimental group (p = 0.006). The significant changes registered in the experimental group at the post-treatment assessment were maintained 1 month after completing the experimental intervention program. In conclusion, these findings indicate that physical exercise performed in water has positive effects on some of the factors that influence mood and quality of life in people with Parkinson's disease.","['Depression', 'Exercise', 'Pain', 'Parkinson’s disease', 'Quality of life']",Acta neurologica Belgica,10.1007/s13760-018-1034-5,2018-11-11,"[{'lastname': 'Pérez-de la Cruz', 'firstname': 'Sagrario', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nursing, Physiotherapy and Medicine, University of Almería, Crta del Sacramento s/n, La Cañada de San Urbano, 04250, Almería, Spain. spd205@ual.es.'}]",30413971,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,DENIED: Springer url (https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13760-018-1034-5.pdf) did not result in a PDF
30350258,"Herbolsheimer, Ungar, Peter",Why Is Social Isolation Among Older Adults Associated with Depressive Symptoms? The Mediating Role of Out-of-Home Physical Activity.,"Social networks are known to be a key factor associated with late-life depression. However, there is limited knowledge about the pathways linking social isolation to mental health. It has been proposed that health-related behaviors such as physical activity represent one pathway. This study examines the way out-of-home physical activity mediates between social isolation and depressive symptoms in older adults.
A subsample of 334 older adults from the ActiFE Ulm study, Germany, was randomly selected. Older adults (M = 72.6 years; 60.8% male) were interviewed at baseline and 3 years later. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Social isolation was measured using the Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS-6). Physical activity was measured by an accelerometer (activPAL) over 1 week. To identify out-of-home physical activity, a contemporary physical activity diary classified out-of-home physical activity.
A cross-lagged structural equation model supported an indirect effect (β = .014, 95% CI .002 to .039) which means that being socially isolated was associated with lower levels of out-of-home physical activity, and this predicted more depressive symptoms after 3 years. However, no direct relationship was observed between social isolation from friends and neighbors at the baseline and depressive symptoms 3 years later.
Utilizing a longitudinal study design and accounting for reverse causality, this study extends prior work linking social isolation to depression by showing that a variety of neighbor and friendship ties are linked to fewer depressive symptoms by providing occasions for out-of-home physical activity.","['Accelerometry', 'Depression', 'Longitudinal', 'Physical activity', 'Social isolation']",International journal of behavioral medicine,10.1007/s12529-018-9752-x,2018-10-24,"[{'lastname': 'Herbolsheimer', 'firstname': 'Florian', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Institute of the History, Philosophy and Ethics of Medicine, Ulm University, Parkstraße 11, 89073, Ulm, Germany. florian.herbolsheimer@alumni.uni-ulm.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Ungar', 'firstname': 'Nadine', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Psychology, Heidelberg University, Hauptstraße 47-51, Heidelberg, 69117, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Peter', 'firstname': 'Richard', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Institute of the History, Philosophy and Ethics of Medicine, Ulm University, Parkstraße 11, 89073, Ulm, Germany.'}]","30350258

30275687,Jang et al.,A multicomponent frailty intervention for socioeconomically vulnerable older adults: a designed-delay study.,"The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a 6-month multicomponent intervention on physical function in socioeconomically vulnerable older adults in rural communities. As secondary aims, we evaluated the effectiveness of the intervention on frailty and other geriatric syndromes, sustained benefit at 12 months, and baseline characteristics associated with poor response.
This designed-delay study was conducted in 187 adults (mean age: 77 years; 75% women) who were living alone or on a low income in three rural regions of Korea. A 24-week multicomponent program that consisted of group exercise, nutritional supplementation, depression management, deprescribing medications, and home hazard reduction was implemented with a planned 6-month interval from August 2015 through January 2017. The primary outcome was physical function, measured using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) score (range: 0-12; minimum clinically important difference ≥1) at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included frailty phenotype, sarcopenia, Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form score (range: 0-14), Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale score (range: 0-60), and falls.
At 6 months, the SPPB score increased by 3.18 points (95% CI: 2.89, 3.48) from baseline. The program improved frailty (odds ratio: 0.06; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.16), sarcopenia (odds ratio: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.68), Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form score by 1.67 points (95% CI: 1.28, 2.06), and Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale score by -3.83 points (95% CI: -5.26, -2.39), except for fall (rate ratio: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.69, 1.43). These beneficial effects were sustained at 12 months. Body mass index ≥27 kg/m
This 24-week multicomponent program had sustained beneficial effects up to 1 year on physical function, frailty, sarcopenia, depressive symptoms, and nutritional status in socioeconomically vulnerable older adults in rural communities.

30257848,Yasunaga et al.,Cross-sectional associations of sedentary behaviour and physical activity on depression in Japanese older adults: an isotemporal substitution approach.,"Reducing sedentary behaviour (SB) and increasing physical activity (PA) have been shown to be associated with decreased depression. However, there are yet few studies examining the potential benefits on older adults' depression, when SB is replaced with PA. This study aimed to examine the associations of objectively assessed SB, light-intensity PA (LPA) and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) with depression among a sample of Japanese older adults, and to explore impacts of substituting SB with PA on older adults' depression.
Cross-sectional analysis.
General community.
A total of 276 older adults aged 65-85 years living in Japan.
Three behaviours including the average daily time spent in SB (≤1.5 METs); LPA (>1.5 to <3.0 METs) and MVPA (≥3.0 METs) per day were calculated by accelerometers. Depression was assessed using the Japanese version of the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15).
Less SB (β=0.129, 95% CI 0.015 to 0.243) and more LPA (β=-0.138, 95% CI -0.265 to -0.011) were found to be significantly and negatively associated with the GDS-15 score in the single-activity model. The isotemporal substitution model found that replacing only 30 min per day of SB with the same amount of LPA to be significantly and negatively associated with the GDS-15 score (β=-0.131, 95% CI -0.260 to -0.002).
These findings indicated that substituting even small amounts of SB with LPA may contribute to less depression in older adults. Potential favourable effects can be observed for replacing only 30 min per day of SB with LPA.","['Active Lifestyle', 'Ageing', 'Mental Health', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Public Health', 'Sport Siences']",BMJ open,"10.1136/bmjopen-2018-022282

30217663,McDowell et al.,Associations of physical activity and depression: Results from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing.,"Physical activity (PA) can protect against depression, but few studies have assessed whether meeting PA guidelines is sufficient, or if benefits can be derived from greater volumes of PA. The present study examines cross-sectional and prospective associations between different volumes of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and walking, and depressive symptoms and status. Participants (n = 4556; 56.7% female) aged ≥ 50 years completed the International PA Questionnaire (IPAQ) at baseline and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale at baseline and two years later. Prevalence and incidence of depression were 9.0% (n = 410) and 5.0% (n = 207), respectively. After full adjustment, odds of prevalent depression were: 40% (OR = 0.60, 95%CI: 0.48-0.76) lower among those meeting PA guidelines; 23% (OR = 0.77, 0.49-1.21) and 43% (OR = 0.57, 0.45-0.73) lower among those in moderate and high categories, respectively; and, 22% (OR = 0.78, 0.61-1.01) and 44.0% (OR = 0.56, 0.42-0.74) lower among those in moderate and high walking tertiles, respectively. Odds of incident depression were: 23% (OR = 0.77, 0.58-1.04) lower among those meeting PA guidelines; 37% (OR = 0.63, 0.32-1.22) and 20.0% (OR = 0.80, 0.59-1.09) lower among those in moderate and high categories, respectively; and, 21% (OR = 0.79, 0.56-1.12) and 25% (OR = 0.75, 0.52-1.07) lower among those in moderate and high walking tertiles, respectively. Moderate and high volumes of MVPA were significantly associated with lower odds of concurrent depression, and significantly and non-significantly associated with reduced odds of incident depression, respectively. Meeting recommended levels of MVPA and walking were associated with significantly lower odds of concurrent depression, and non-significantly reduced odds of the development of depression over two years.","['Cross-sectional', 'Depression', 'Elderly', 'Physical activity', 'Prospective']",Experimental gerontology,10.1016/j.exger.2018.09.004,2018-09-16,"[{'lastname': 'McDowell', 'firstname': 'C P', 'initials': 'CP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical Education and Sport Sciences, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland.

30185064,Koutsouras et al.,Effects of depression and exercise on health-related quality of life in patients with Parkinson's disease.,"There is limited literature describing the effect exercise may have on depression and an individual's health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in Parkinson's Disease (PD). We aim to quantify this effect.
A cross-sectional questionnaire was administered to 60 PD subjects. The Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39) summary index and the Geriatric Depression Scale-30 were used to quantify HRQoL and depression, respectively. Data were obtained on exercise habits. ANOVA and multivariate linear regression analysis were used to calculate mean differences in HRQoL.
Depression was consistently related to HRQoL (
Exercising and depression may interact to affect HRQoL. Thus, coordination of mental health evaluation and exercise regimens in persons with PD may improve HRQoL.","['Parkinson’s disease', 'depression', 'exercise', 'physical activity', 'quality of life']",Chronic illness,10.1177/1742395318796166,2018-09-07,"[{'lastname': 'Koutsouras', 'firstname': 'George W', 'initials': 'GW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Osteopathic Medicine, New York Institute of Technology, Old Westbury, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Levine', 'firstname': 'Kimberly', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Osteopathic Medicine, New York Institute of Technology, Old Westbury, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Duroseau', 'firstname': 'Nathalie', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Osteopathic Medicine, New York Institute of Technology, Old Westbury, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ciraco', 'firstname': 'Christina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Osteopathic Medicine, New York Institute of Technology, Old Westbury, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Chan', 'firstname': 'Vivian', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Osteopathic Medicine, New York Institute of Technology, Old Westbury, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Pergament', 'firstname': 'Kathleen', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Osteopathic Medicine, New York Institute of Technology, Old Westbury, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Chan', 'firstname': 'Thomas', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Osteopathic Medicine, New York Institute of Technology, Old Westbury, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Mancini', 'firstname': 'Jayme D', 'initials': 'JD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine, College of Osteopathic Medicine, New York Institute of Technology, Old Westbury, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Leder', 'firstname': 'Adena N', 'initials': 'AN', 'affiliation': 'Department of Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine, College of Osteopathic Medicine, New York Institute of Technology, Old Westbury, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Krishnamachari', 'firstname': 'Bhuma', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Osteopathic Medicine, New York Institute of Technology, Old Westbury, NY, USA.'}]",30185064,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Chronic Illn"""

This study followed a descriptive design. The population of the study consisted of 11 750 individuals at least 65 years old. The sample size of the study was determined to be 967 by power analysis. Descriptive statistics and logistic models were used for data analysis.
Together, age, the presence of a caregiver, chronic disease, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) score explained 32% of the variance in the physical activity of the elderly. Among these factors, the GDS score alone had the greatest effect.

30138807,Asai et al.,"Farming habit, light exposure, physical activity, and depressive symptoms. A cross-sectional study of the HEIJO-KYO cohort.","Bright light therapy and exercise interventions are effective methods for treating seasonal and non-seasonal affective disorders. Synchronization of internal circadian rhythms with the external environment by light therapy and physical activity may partly explain its efficacy. In the present study, we objectively measured daytime light exposure and physical activity in real life situations with elderly participants, and investigated the association between farming habits and the prevalence of depressive symptoms.
This cross-sectional was conducted among 1005 participants (mean age: 71.5) of a community-based cohort study. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS score ≥ 6) and administration of antidepressant.
Farming habit with long duration (> 7.0 h/week) showed significantly lower odds ratios (OR) for depressive symptoms (adjusted OR 0.63, 95% confidential interval,0.41 to 0.96) compared with participants without farming habit independent of confounders such as age, gender, body mass index smoking, drinking, daytime ambulatory systolic blood pressure, diabetes, living alone, education, income, and daylength. Even in farming with short duration (≤ 7.0 h/week), we found significant association with lower OR for depressive symptoms (adjusted OR 0.64, 95%CI, 0.42 to 0.97). Light exposure and daytime physical activity measured by wrist actigraphy were significantly higher among participants with longer farming habits (p for trend < 0.01). Physical activity mediated 12.0% of association between farming habit and depressive symptoms.
A cross-sectional association may be found because the participants with depressive symptoms tended to avoid farming. A longitudinal study is warranted to determine the direction of causality.
Participants with farming habit showed significantly lower OR for depressive symptoms than those without farming habit, and it was partly mediated by physical activity.","['Circadian rhythm', 'Elderly', 'Farming, depression', 'Light exposure', 'Physical activity']",Journal of affective disorders,10.1016/j.jad.2018.08.003,2018-08-24,"[{'lastname': 'Asai', 'firstname': 'Yuji', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Nara Medical University School of Medicine, Nara, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Obayashi', 'firstname': 'Kenji', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Nara Medical University School of Medicine, Nara, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Oume', 'firstname': 'Masataka', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Nara Medical University School of Medicine, Nara, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Ogura', 'firstname': 'Moe', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Nara Medical University School of Medicine, Nara, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Takeuchi', 'firstname': 'Katsuya', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Nara Medical University School of Medicine, Nara, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yamagami', 'firstname': 'Yuki', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Nara Medical University School of Medicine, Nara, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Tai', 'firstname': 'Yoshiaki', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Nara Medical University School of Medicine, Nara, Japan; Department of General Medicine, Nara Medical University School of Medicine, Nara, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kurumatani', 'firstname': 'Norio', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Nara Medical University School of Medicine, Nara, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Saeki', 'firstname': 'Keigo', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Nara Medical University School of Medicine, Nara, Japan.

30092314,Orstad et al.,Neighborhood walkability and physical activity among older women: Tests of mediation by environmental perceptions and moderation by depressive symptoms.,"Features that enhance neighborhood walkability (higher population density, street connectivity and access to destinations) are associated with higher levels of physical activity among older adults. The perceived neighborhood environment appears to mediate associations between the objective built environment and physical activity. The role of depressed mood in these associations is poorly understood. We examined the degree to which depressive symptoms moderated indirect associations between the objective neighborhood environment and physical activity via the perceived neighborhood environment in older women. We analyzed data on 60,133 women (mean age = 73.1 ± 6.7 years) in the U.S. Nurses' Health Study cohort who completed the 2008 questionnaire. Self-reported measures included the Geriatric Depression Scale, perceived presence of recreational facilities, retail destinations, sidewalks, and crime, and participation in recreational physical activity and neighborhood walking. We created an objective walkability index by summing z-scores of intersection and facility counts within 1200-meter residential network buffers and census tract-level population density. We used multiple regression with bootstrap-generated 95% bias-corrected confidence intervals (BC CIs) to test for mediation and moderated mediation. Objective walkability was associated with 1.99 times greater odds of neighborhood walking (95% BC CI = 1.92, 2.06) and 1.38 times greater odds of meeting physical activity recommendations (95% BC CI = 1.34, 1.43) via the perceived neighborhood environment. These indirect associations were weaker among women with higher depressive symptom scores. Positive associations between objective neighborhood walkability and physical activities such as walking among older women may be strengthened with a reduction in their depressive symptoms.",[],Preventive medicine,"10.1016/j.ypmed.2018.08.008

29940519,Adjibade et al.,Prospective association between combined healthy lifestyles and risk of depressive symptoms in the French NutriNet-Santé cohort.,"Several modifiable lifestyle indicators, including diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, weight and physical activity have been associated with depression; however, their combined effect has been less studied. The aim of this study was to calculate a Healthy Lifestyle Index (HLI) composed of the 5 above-mentioned indicators and investigate its association with incident depressive symptoms.
The study sample consisted of 25,837 participants from the NutriNet-Santé study, initially free of depressive symptoms. The HLI was computed by assigning 1 point to each lifestyle indicator namely healthy diet, healthy weight, moderate or high physical activity, never smoking and low alcohol consumption. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Hazard Ratios were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models and population attributable risks (PAR) were calculated.
A total of 2112 incident cases of depressive symptoms were identified over a mean follow-up of 5 years. After accounting for a wide range of potential confounders, a 1-point increase in the HLI was associated with a 10% (95% CI 6%; 13%) reduction in the risk of depressive symptoms. The estimated PAR representing the proportion of cases that are attributable to non-adherence to specific healthy lifestyle indicators were 8% for healthy diet, 5% for healthy weight, 5% for non-smoking and 14% for the non-adherence to a combination of healthy diet, healthy weight and non-smoking.
Some unmeasured factors related to both depression and lifestyle indicators, such as family history of depressive disorder, stressful life events, and sleep disorders might have led to potential residual confounding.
Modifying unhealthy lifestyles, especially diet, weight and smoking, is a potential target of major interest in the prevention of depressive symptoms in adults.","['Combined impacts', 'Depression', 'Lifestyle indicators', 'Mental health', 'Population attributable risk']",Journal of affective disorders,10.1016/j.jad.2018.05.038,2018-06-26,"[{'lastname': 'Adjibade', 'firstname': 'Moufidath', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Equipe de Recherche en Epidémiologie Nutritionnelle (EREN), Université Paris 13, Centre d'Epidémiologie et Statistiques Sorbonne Paris Cité, Inserm (U1153), Inra (U1125), Cnam, COMUE Sorbonne Paris Cité, 74 rue Marcel Cachin, F-93017 Bobigny, France.

29936330,Shimizu et al.,"Walking ability, anxiety and depression, significantly decrease EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level scores in older hemodialysis patients in Japan.","Hemodialysis patients in Japan are aging, but the influence of lifestyle factors on EuroQoL 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5 L) scores in older hemodialysis patients is unclear. This study aimed to measure health-related quality of life using the EQ-5D-5 L for older hemodialysis patients and to identify the lifestyle factors affecting EQ-5D-5 L scores in Japan.
Outpatients aged 65 years or older who had been receiving maintenance hemodialysis for more than 5 years were selected to determine their EQ-5D-5 L scores. Multiple linear regression analysis was applied to identify items affecting the EQ-5D-5 L scores.
The response rate was 59.7% (748/1251), after excluding 9 patients who did not fulfill the participation criteria, and we analyzed data from 739 patients (462 men, 277 women) aged 72.9 ± 6.5 years (mean ± standard deviation) with a mean duration of hemodialysis of 15.1 ± 8.8 years. The mean EQ-5D-5 L score was 0.738 ± 0.207. Higher Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores (regression coefficient, -0.467; P < 0.001), reduced walking ability (-0.201; P < 0.001), duration of hemodialysis (-0.175; P < 0.001), age (-0.143; P < 0.001), and subjective symptoms (-0.128; P < 0.001) showed significant negative correlations with the EQ-5D-5 L score.
Reduced walking ability, and Anxiety and Depression, were associated with lower EQ-5D-5 L score and appeared to be important factors in decreasing health for older hemodialysis patients. These results suggest that patients' families and dialysis facility staff should be trained in early detection of depression and that patients should maintain their walking ability by exercise therapy.","['EQ-5D-5L', 'Health utility', 'Hemodialysis', 'Older']",Archives of gerontology and geriatrics,10.1016/j.archger.2018.06.006,2018-06-25,"[{'lastname': 'Shimizu', 'firstname': 'Utako', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'Graduate School of Health Sciences, Niigata University, 2-746 Asahimachi-dori, Chuo-ku, Niigata 951-8518, Japan.

29716654,Iijima et al.,Psychological health is associated with knee pain and physical function in patients with knee osteoarthritis: an exploratory cross-sectional study.,"Depressive symptoms are a major comorbidity in older adults with knee osteoarthritis (OA). However, the type of activity-induced knee pain associated with depression has not been examined. Furthermore, there is conflicting evidence regarding the association between depression and performance-based physical function. This study aimed to examine (i) the association between depressive symptoms and knee pain intensity, particularly task-specific knee pain during daily living, and (ii) the association between depressive symptoms and performance-based physical function, while considering other potential risk factors, including bilateral knee pain and ambulatory physical activity.
Patients in orthopaedic clinics (n = 95; age, 61-91 years; 67.4% female) who were diagnosed with radiographic knee OA (Kellgren/Lawrence [K/L] grade ≥ 1) underwent evaluation of psychological health using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Knee pain and physical function were assessed using the Japanese Knee Osteoarthritis Measure (JKOM), 10-m walk, timed up and go (TUG), and five-repetition chair stand tests.
Ordinal logistic regression analysis showed that depression, defined as a GDS score ≥ 5 points, was significantly associated with a worse score on the JKOM pain-subcategory and a higher level of task-specific knee pain intensity during daily living, after being adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), K/L grade, and ambulatory physical activity. Furthermore, depression was significantly associated with a slower gait velocity and a longer TUG time, after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, K/L grade, presence of bilateral knee pain, and ambulatory physical activity.
These findings indicate that depression may be associated with increased knee pain intensity during daily living in a non-task-specific manner and is associated with functional limitation in patients with knee OA, even after controlling for covariates, including bilateral knee pain and ambulatory physical activity.","['Depression', 'Functional limitation', 'Knee osteoarthritis', 'Knee pain', 'Physical activity']",BMC psychology,"10.1186/s40359-018-0234-3

29709263,Zhu et al.,Sedentary Behavior and the Risk of Depression in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndromes.,"Although there is good evidence that sedentary behavior is associated with poor health outcomes in healthy persons and patients with cardiovascular disease, the mental health consequences of sedentary behavior have not been widely studied. In this report, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis to examine the relation of self-reported sedentary behavior and depression in a sample of 4,043 hospitalized men and women with acute coronary syndrome enrolled in a randomized clinical trial in rural China. Sedentary behavior was assessed by self-report, and depression was assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9); a subset of 1,209 patients also completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Results revealed that greater sedentary behavior was associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms measured by both the PHQ-9 (p <0.001) and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (p <0.001). Compared with patients who reported that they were seldom sedentary, patients reporting that they were frequently sedentary were 4.7 times (odds ratio 4.73, 95% confidence interval 2.71 to 8.24) more likely to be clinically depressed defined as PHQ-9 scores ≥10 after adjusting for demographic factors, lifestyle behaviors, clinical characteristics, and in-hospital treatments. In conclusion, greater sedentary behavior is significantly related to greater depression in Chinese patients with acute coronary syndrome, independent of physical activity. These findings suggest that strategies to reduce sedentary behavior may improve medical outcomes and reduce risk for depression.",[],The American journal of cardiology,10.1016/j.amjcard.2018.02.031,2018-05-02,"[{'lastname': 'Zhu', 'firstname': 'Yidan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Peking University, Beijing, China; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina.'}, {'lastname': 'Blumenthal', 'firstname': 'James A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina.'}, {'lastname': 'Shi', 'firstname': 'Chuan', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Peking University Institute of Mental Health, Sixth Hospital, Beijing, China; National Clinical Research Center for Mental Disorders, Peking University Sixth Hospital, Beijing, China; Key Laboratory of Mental Health, Ministry of Health, Peking University, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Jiang', 'firstname': 'Ronghuan', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': ""Department of Psychiatry, Chinese PLA (People's Liberation Army) Medical School, Beijing, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Patel', 'firstname': 'Anushka', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'The George Institute for Global Health, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Aihua', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'The George Institute for Global Health at Peking University Health Science Center (PUHSC), Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yu', 'firstname': 'Xin', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Peking University Institute of Mental Health, Sixth Hospital, Beijing, China; National Clinical Research Center for Mental Disorders, Peking University Sixth Hospital, Beijing, China; Key Laboratory of Mental Health, Ministry of Health, Peking University, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Gao', 'firstname': 'Runlin', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'The Department of Cardiology, Fuwai Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Yangfeng', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Peking University, Beijing, China; The George Institute for Global Health at Peking University Health Science Center (PUHSC), Beijing, China; Peking University Clinical Research Institute, Beijing, China.

29661194,"Pun, Manjourides, Suh","Association of neighborhood greenness with self-perceived stress, depression and anxiety symptoms in older U.S adults.","Neighborhood environment, such as green vegetation, has been shown to play a role in coping with stress and mental ill health. Yet, epidemiological evidence of the association between greenness and mental health is inconsistent.
We examined whether living in green space is associated with self-perceived stress, depressive and anxiety symptoms in a nationally representative, longitudinal sample of community-dwelling older adults (N = 4118; aged 57-85 years) in the United States. We evaluated perceived stress, depression and anxiety symptoms using the Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale, the Center for Epidemiological Studies - Depression, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - anxiety subscale, respectively. Greenness was assessed for each participant using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index at 250-m resolution, as well as a buffer of 1000-m. We conducted longitudinal analyses to assess the associations between greenness and mental health upon adjusting for confounders (e.g., education), and to examine potential mediation and effect modification.
An interquartile range (0.25 point) increase in contemporaneous greenness was significantly associated with 0.238 unit (95% CI: - 0.346, - 0.130) and 0.162 unit (95% CI: - 0.271, - 0.054) decrease in the perceived stress in base and multivariable models, respectively. The magnitude of the association was similar or even stronger when examining summer (- 0.161; 95% CI: - 0.295, - 0.027) and annual average of greenness (- 0.188; 95% CI: - 0.337, - 0.038), as well as greenness buffer of 1000-m. The greenness-stress association was partially mediated by physical activity (15.1% mediated), where increased greenness led to increased physical activity and less stress, and by history of respiratory diseases (- 3.8% mediated), where increased greenness led to increased respiratory disease and more stress. The association was also significantly modified by race, social support, physical function, socioeconomic status, and region. While greenness was not significantly associated with anxiety and depressive scores across all participants, significant inverse associations were found for Whites participants, and for individuals with higher socioeconomic status, who were physically active, as compared to their counterparts.
We found a direct association of greenness with perceived stress among older adults, and an indirect association mediated through physical activity and respiratory disease history. Our study findings warrant further examination of the mediation and modification of the greenness-mental health association.","['Anxiety', 'Depression', 'Effect modification', 'Green space', 'Mediation', 'Perceived stress']",Environmental health : a global access science source,"10.1186/s12940-018-0381-2

29608340,Hernandez et al.,The impact of exercise on depressive symptoms in older Hispanic/Latino adults: results from the '¡Caminemos!' study.,"We examined the prospective effects of an evidence-based exercise intervention on depressive symptoms in older Hispanics/Latinos and the potential synergistic effects (if any) of an attribution-retraining component to counter negative ascriptions to the aging process.
We analyzed baseline, 1-, 12-, 24-month data collected from Hispanics/Latinos ≥ 60 years participating in an exercise intervention (""¡Caminemos!"") across 27 senior centers (N = 572). All participants were given 4 weekly 1-hour group-based exercise classes targeting strength training, endurance, balance and flexibility. In addition, they were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: a) treatment group-a 1-hour attribution retraining session where participants were taught that aging does not mean one inevitably becomes sedentary, or b) control group-generic health education. The Geriatric Depression Scale was used to assess depressive symptoms. Covariates included age, sex, education, income, marital status, acculturation, and number of chronic conditions.
In prospective analyses, participants in both trial arms displayed lower scores for depressive symptoms at 12- (β1 = -0.17, p = 0.04) and 24-months (β2 = -0.33, p < 0.001) when compared to baseline values.
Given expected growth of the older Hispanic/Latino adult population, exercise programs are a promising strategy in promoting favorable mental health.","['Older Hispanic/Latino adults', 'age reattribution', 'depressive symptoms', 'exercise intervention', 'randomized trial']",Aging & mental health,"10.1080/13607863.2018.1450833

29582161,Indelicato et al.,Sex differences in the association of psychological status with measures of physical activity and sedentary behaviour in adults with type 2 diabetes.,"To assess the association of psychological variables on leisure-time physical activity and sedentary time in men and women with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D).
In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated 163 patients with T2D, consecutively recruited at the Diabetes Centre of the Verona General Hospital. Scores on depression and anxiety symptoms, psychosocial factors (including self-efficacy, perceived interference, perceived severity, social support, misguided support behaviour, spouse's positive behaviour), physical activity and time spent sitting were ascertained using questionnaires responses to the Beck Depression Inventory-II, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Multidimensional Diabetes Questionnaire, International Physical Activity Questionnaire.
Physical activity was significantly associated with higher social support in women and with increased self-efficacy in men. Sedentary time was significantly associated with higher perceived interference, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and with reduced diabetes self-efficacy in women, while it was associated solely with anxiety in men. Depressive symptoms and self-efficacy in women and anxiety symptoms in men were independent predictors of sedentary time when entered in a multivariable regression model also including age, BMI, haemoglobin A1c, diabetes duration, perceived interference and self-efficacy as covariates.
Lower self-efficacy and higher symptoms of depression were closely associated with increased sedentary time in women, but not in men, with T2D. It is possible that individualized behavioural interventions designed to reduce depressive symptoms and to improve diabetes self-efficacy would ultimately reduce sedentary behaviours, particularly in women with T2D.","['Anxiety', 'Depression', 'Diabetes', 'Physical activity', 'Sedentary behaviour']",Acta diabetologica,10.1007/s00592-018-1132-0,2018-03-28,"[{'lastname': 'Indelicato', 'firstname': 'Liliana', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, University of Verona and Hospital Trust of Verona, Piazzale Stefani, 1, 37126, Verona, Italy. liliana.indelicato@univr.it.'}, {'lastname': 'Dauriz', 'firstname': 'Marco', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, University of Verona and Hospital Trust of Verona, Piazzale Stefani, 1, 37126, Verona, Italy. marco.dauriz@univr.it.'}, {'lastname': 'Bacchi', 'firstname': 'Elisabetta', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, University of Verona and Hospital Trust of Verona, Piazzale Stefani, 1, 37126, Verona, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Donà', 'firstname': 'Silvia', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, University of Verona and Hospital Trust of Verona, Piazzale Stefani, 1, 37126, Verona, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Santi', 'firstname': 'Lorenza', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, University of Verona and Hospital Trust of Verona, Piazzale Stefani, 1, 37126, Verona, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Negri', 'firstname': 'Carlo', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, University of Verona and Hospital Trust of Verona, Piazzale Stefani, 1, 37126, Verona, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Cacciatori', 'firstname': 'Vittorio', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, University of Verona and Hospital Trust of Verona, Piazzale Stefani, 1, 37126, Verona, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Bonora', 'firstname': 'Enzo', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, University of Verona and Hospital Trust of Verona, Piazzale Stefani, 1, 37126, Verona, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Nouwen', 'firstname': 'Arie', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Middlesex University, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Moghetti', 'firstname': 'Paolo', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, University of Verona and Hospital Trust of Verona, Piazzale Stefani, 1, 37126, Verona, Italy.'}]",29582161,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,DENIED: Springer url (https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00592-018-1132-0.pdf) did not result in a PDF
29580209,Arrieta et al.,"Physical activity and fitness are associated with verbal memory, quality of life and depression among nursing home residents: preliminary data of a randomized controlled trial.","Few studies have simultaneously examined changes in physical, cognitive and emotional performance throughout the aging process.
Baseline data from an ongoing experimental randomized study were analyzed. Physical activity, handgrip, the Senior Fitness Test, Trail Making Test A, Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test, Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease Scale (QoL-AD) and the Goldberg Depression Scale were used to assess study participants. Logistic regression models were applied.
ACTRN12616001044415 (04/08/2016).
The study enrolled 114 participants with a mean age of 84.9 (standard deviation 6.9) years from ten different nursing homes. After adjusting for age, gender and education level, upper limb muscle strength was found to be associated with Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test [EXP(B): 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04-1.30] and QoL-AD [EXP(B): 1.18, 95% CI: 1.06-1.31]. Similarly, the number of steps taken per day was negatively associated with the risk of depression according to the Goldberg Depression Scale [EXP(B): 1.14, 95% CI: 1.000-1.003]. Additional analyses suggest that the factors associated with these variables are different according to the need for using an assistive device for walking. In those participants who used it, upper limb muscle strength remained associated with Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test [EXP(B): 1.21, 95% CI: 1.01-1.44] and QoL-AD tests [EXP(B): 1.19, 95% CI: 1.02-1.40]. In those individuals who did not need an assistive device for walking, lower limb muscle strength was associated with Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test [EXP(B): 1.35, 95% CI: 1.07-1.69], time spent in light physical activity was associated with QoL-AD test [EXP(B): 1.13, 95% CI: 1.00-1.02], and the number of steps walked per day was negatively associated with the risk of depression according to the Goldberg Depression Scale [EXP(B): 1.27, 95% CI: 1.000-1.004].
Muscle strength and physical activity are factors positively associated with a better performance on the Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test, QoL-AD and Goldberg Depression Scale in older adults with mild to moderate cognitive impairment living in nursing homes. These associations appeared to differ according to the use of an assistive device for walking. Our findings support the need for the implementation of interventions directed to increase the strength and physical activity of individuals living in nursing homes to promote physical, cognitive and emotional benefits.

29557570,Caccamo et al.,The measure of effectiveness of a short-term 2-week intensive Cardiac Rehabilitation program in decreasing levels of anxiety and depression.,"Research on heart disease have found a strong and consistent evidence of association between some psychosocial risk factors, including depression, anxiety, self-efficacy, lack of social support and outcome of disease. Depression increases the risk of cardiac death and is highly predictive of reduced adherence to recommended treatments; anxiety appears to be linked to adverse cardiac outcomes. It was demonstrated that Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR) leads to substantial improvements and positive outcomes because combines the prescription of physical activity with the modification of risk factors and aims to reduce symptoms related to the disease and the risk of new cardiovascular events. The main objective of this study is to determine if a short and intense CR program can produce a positive impact on anxious and depressive symptoms revealed in cardiac patients, confirming results of previous researches. The protocol was proposed to all patients referred for an outpatient CR after an acute event who attended the short 2-week intensive rehabilitation program. A total of 157 patients recruited at the operating unit of Cardiology, in the Hospital of Cittadella (Italy), was included in the analysis. The Beck Depression Inventory-II and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Y were administered to the patients. SPSS 17.0 was used for statistical analysis. T-tests for paired samples were used to evaluate differences between the beginning and the end of the CR program. There was a statistically significant difference between the beginning and the end of the CR program. Results for paired samples showed significant differences in all factors of the BDI-II and in the total score. In addition, a statistically significant difference was found even in the state - anxiety subscale. No significant difference was detected for the trait anxiety. According to recent studies, this research shows that the CR program has a significant impact on levels of anxiety and depression, because all activities focus their commitment on changing the patient's personal beliefs and perception of illness, promoting the exchange of information and sharing of concerns and fears, increasing the patient's resilience with the aim of enabling him/her to reorganize positively his/her personal, family and professional sphere.","['Cardiac Rehabilitation', 'anxiety', 'depression', 'effectiveness.']",Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace,10.4081/monaldi.2018.858,2018-03-21,"[{'lastname': 'Caccamo', 'firstname': 'Floriana', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'University of Padua, Department of Philosophy, Sociology, Pedagogy and Applied Psychology. floriana.caccamo@unipd.it.'}, {'lastname': 'Saltini', 'firstname': 'Simone', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Carella', 'firstname': 'Enrico', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Carlon', 'firstname': 'Roberto', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Marogna', 'firstname': 'Cristina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sava', 'firstname': 'Vito', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': None}]",29557570,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Monaldi Arch Chest Dis"""
29529548,Furihata et al.,Unhealthy lifestyle factors and depressive symptoms: A Japanese general adult population survey.,"To investigate the relationship between unhealthy lifestyles factors and depressive symptoms among the general adult population in Japan.
Participants were randomly selected from the Japanese general adult population. Data from 2334 people aged 20 years or older were analyzed. This cross-sectional survey was conducted in August and September 2009. Participants completed a face-to-face interview about unhealthy lifestyle factors, including lack of exercise, skipping breakfast, a poorly balanced diet, snacking between meals, insufficient sleep, current smoking, alcohol drinking, and obesity. Presence of depressive symptoms was defined as a score of ≥ 16 on the Japanese version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Relationships between unhealthy lifestyle factors and depressive symptoms were evaluated by multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusting for sociodemographic variables and other unhealthy lifestyle factors.
Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that insufficient sleep, a poorly balanced diet, snacking between meals and lack of exercise were significantly associated with the prevalence of depressive symptoms, with odds ratios ranging from 1.56 for lack of exercise to 3.98 for insufficient sleep.
Since this study was a cross-sectional study, causal relationships could not be determined.
These results suggest that promoting a healthy lifestyle focused on sleep, food intake and exercise may be important for individuals with depressive symptoms.","['Depression', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Food intake', 'Insufficient sleep', 'Japan', 'Lifestyle']",Journal of affective disorders,10.1016/j.jad.2018.02.093,2018-03-13,"[{'lastname': 'Furihata', 'firstname': 'Ryuji', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Konno', 'firstname': 'Chisato', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Suzuki', 'firstname': 'Masahiro', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Takahashi', 'firstname': 'Sakae', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kaneita', 'firstname': 'Yoshitaka', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Division of Public Health, Department of Social Medicine, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Ohida', 'firstname': 'Takashi', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Division of Public Health, Department of Social Medicine, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Uchiyama', 'firstname': 'Makoto', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.

29407540,Murri et al.,Physical exercise for late-life depression: Effects on symptom dimensions and time course.,"Physical exercise is increasingly recognized as a treatment for major depression, even among older patients. However, it is still unknown which depressive symptoms exercise affects most, (e.g. somatic vs. affective) and the timing of its effects. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine the changes of depressive symptoms after treatment with exercise.
We analyzed data from the SEEDS study, a trial comparing the antidepressant effectiveness of sertraline (S) and sertraline plus exercise (S+EX). Exercise was delivered thrice weekly in small groups and monitored by heart rate meters. Patients with late life depression (n=121) were assessed at baseline, 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks with the Hamilton Depression Scale. Scores of affective, vegetative, anxiety and agitation/insight factors were analyzed using Multilevel Growth Curve Models and sensitivity analyses (multiple imputation).
Compared with the S group, patients in the S+EX group displayed significantly greater improvements of the affective symptom dimension (total effect size = 0.79) with largest changes in the first 4 weeks and last 12 weeks. Improvements were mainly driven by depressed mood and psychomotor retardation.
Sample size; lack of an exercise only treatment arm CONCLUSIONS: Adding exercise to antidepressant drug treatment may offer significant advantages over affective symptoms of depression, rather than somatic symptoms or other dimensions of depression. Compared with standard antidepressant treatment, clinical advantages should be expected both at an early (first 4 weeks) and later stage (after 12 weeks).","['Affective', 'Antidepressants', 'Depression', 'Exercise', 'Mood', 'Psychomotor retardation']",Journal of affective disorders,10.1016/j.jad.2018.01.004,2018-02-07,"[{'lastname': 'Murri', 'firstname': 'Martino Belvederi', 'initials': 'MB', 'affiliation': 'Section of Psychiatry, Department of Neuroscience, Oftalmology, Genetics and Infant-Maternal Science, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.

29382402,McDowell et al.,Associations of physical activity with anxiety symptoms and status: results from The Irish longitudinal study on ageing.,"Anxiety is debilitating and associated with numerous mental and physical comorbidities. There is a need to identify and investigate low-risk prevention and treatment strategies. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between different volumes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (PA) and anxiety symptoms and status among older adults in Ireland.
Participants (n = 4175; 56.8% female) aged ⩾50 years completed the International PA Questionnaire (IPAQ) at baseline, and the anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at baseline and follow-up (2009-2013). Participants were classified according to meeting World Health Organisation PA guidelines, and divided into IPAQ categories. Respondents without anxiety at baseline (n = 3165) were included in prospective analyses. Data were analysed in 2017.
Anxiety symptoms were significantly higher among females than males (p &lt; 0.001). Models were adjusted for age, sex, waist circumference, social class, smoking status and pain. In cross-sectional analyses, meeting PA guidelines was associated with 9.3% (OR = 0.91, 95% confidence interval 0.78-1.06) lower odds of anxiety. Compared with the inactive group, the minimally- and very-active groups were associated with 8.4% (OR = 0.92, 0.76-1.10) and 18.8% (OR = 0.81, 0.67-0.98) lower odds of anxiety, respectively. In prospective analyses, meeting guidelines was associated with 6.3% (OR = 0.94, 0.63-1.40) reduced odds of anxiety. Compared with the inactive group, the minimally and very-active groups were associated with 43.5% (OR = 1.44, 0.89-2.32) increased, and 4.3% (OR = 0.96, 0.56-1.63) reduced odds of anxiety. The presence of pain, included in models as a covariate, was associated with a 108.7% (OR = 2.09, 1.80-2.42) increase in odds of prevalent anxiety, and a 109.7% (OR = 2.10, 1.41-3.11) increase in odds of incident anxiety.
High volumes of PA are cross-sectionally associated with lower anxiety symptoms and status, with a potential dose-response apparent. However, significant associations were not observed in prospective analyses. The low absolute number of incident anxiety cases (n = 109) potentially influenced these findings. Further, as older adults may tend to experience and/or report more somatic anxiety symptoms, and the HADS focuses primarily on cognitive symptoms, it is plausible that the HADS was not an optimal measure of anxiety symptoms in the current population.","['Anxiety', 'Ireland', 'cross-sectional', 'elderly', 'longitudinal', 'physical activity']",Epidemiology and psychiatric sciences,10.1017/S204579601800001X,2018-02-01,"[{'lastname': 'McDowell', 'firstname': 'C P', 'initials': 'CP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical Education and Sport Sciences,University of Limerick,Limerick,Ireland.'}, {'lastname': 'Gordon', 'firstname': 'B R', 'initials': 'BR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical Education and Sport Sciences,University of Limerick,Limerick,Ireland.'}, {'lastname': 'Andrews', 'firstname': 'K L', 'initials': 'KL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical Education and Sport Sciences,University of Limerick,Limerick,Ireland.'}, {'lastname': 'MacDonncha', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical Education and Sport Sciences,University of Limerick,Limerick,Ireland.'}, {'lastname': 'Herring', 'firstname': 'M P', 'initials': 'MP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical Education and Sport Sciences,University of Limerick,Limerick,Ireland.'}]","29382402

29358436,Dillon et al.,"Associations between physical behaviour patterns and levels of depressive symptoms, anxiety and well-being in middle-aged adults: a cross-sectional study using isotemporal substitution models.","To examine the compositional effects of physical behaviour on mental health.
Cross-sectional study.
A population-representative random sample (Mitchelstown cohort) was recruited from a large primary care centre in Mitchelstown, County Cork, Ireland.
In total 3807 potential participants were selected from the practice list. Following exclusion of duplicates, deaths and ineligibles, 3043 were invited to participate and of these, 2047 (49.2% men) completed the questionnaire and physical examination components of the baseline assessment during the study period (April 2010 and May 2011). Accelerometers were introduced into the study in January 2011. Of the 745 participants seen between January and May of 2011, 475 (44.6% men) subjects (response rate 64%) agreed to participate and of these 397 (46.1% men) had valid accelerometer data.
Participants wore the wrist GENEActiv accelerometer for 7 consecutive days. Data were summarised into 60 s epochs and activity categorised as sedentary behaviour, light or moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Well-being was assessed using the WHO-5 well-being scale.
In adjusted isotemporal models, a 30 min increase in light activity per day was associated with a significant decrease in levels of anxiety symptoms (B=-0.34; 95% CI -0.64 to -0.04) and a significant increase in levels of well-being (B=0.58; 95% CI 0.05 to 1.11). No statistically significant associations were observed between any physical behaviour and depressive symptoms or when sedentary behaviour was substituted with MVPA (P>0.05).
Although based on a cross-sectional study, the findings suggest that substituting light activity for sedentary behaviour may have positive associations with symptoms of anxiety and reported well-being among middle-aged adults.","['anxiety disorders', 'epidemiology', 'mental health', 'physical activity']",BMJ open,"10.1136/bmjopen-2017-018978

29156451,Yu et al.,Impact of Stressful Life Events on Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.,"There is a general notion that stressful life events may cause mental and physical health problems.
We aimed to describe stressful life events reported by patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and to assess their impact on health outcomes and behaviors.
Two hundred and sixty-six primary care patients who participated in the ICE COLD ERIC cohort study were asked to document any stressful life events in the past 3 years. We assessed the before-after (the event) changes for symptoms of depression and anxiety, health status, dyspnea-related quality of life, exacerbations, cigarette use, and physical activity. We used linear regression analysis to estimate the crude and adjusted magnitude of the before-after changes.
About 41% (110/266) of patients reported the experience of any stressful life events and ""death of relatives/important persons"" was most common (31%). After accounting for age, sex, living status, lung function, and anxiety/depression status at baseline, experiencing any stressful life events was associated with a 0.9-point increase on the depression scale (95% CI 0.3 to 1.4), a 0.8-point increase on the anxiety scale (95% CI 0.3 to 1.3), and a 0.8-point decrease in the physical activity score (95% CI -1.6 to 0).
Experiencing stressful life events was associated with a small to moderate increase in symptoms of depression and anxiety in COPD, but no discernable effect was found for other physical outcomes. However, confirmation of these results in other COPD cohorts and identification of patients particularly vulnerable to stressful life events are needed.","['Anxiety', 'Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease', 'Depression', 'ICE COLD ERIC cohort study', 'Physical activity', 'Stressful life events']",Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases,10.1159/000481714,2017-11-21,"[{'lastname': 'Yu', 'firstname': 'Tsung', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.\nDepartment of Public Health, China Medical University and Big Data Center, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Frei', 'firstname': 'Anja', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Ter Riet', 'firstname': 'Gerben', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of General Practice/Family Medicine, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Puhan', 'firstname': 'Milo A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.'}]",29156451,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,TXERROR: 403 status returned from Karger url (http://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/481714)

ENHANCED was a 3-month clinical trial examining standard CR with and without stress management training (SMT). Participants completed the Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (LTEQ), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) at baseline, 3- and 12-months after randomization. Prospective associations between physical activity and psychosocial function, as well as treatment group differences, were examined using repeated measures mixed modeling.
One hundred nineteen participants were available at 12month follow-up. During the 12-month follow-up, PA remained higher compared to baseline (P<0.001), with the majority of participants reporting that they engaged in PA on a regular basis. Depressive and anxious symptoms continued to remain lower than baseline (Ps<0.001) Higher levels of PA at 12-month follow-up were associated with lower depressive (P=0.032) and anxious (P=0.003) symptoms.
Higher physical activity levels following CR are associated with lower depressive and anxious symptoms. Encouraging patients to sustain higher levels of PA may promote both cardiovascular and mental health.","['Anxiety', 'Cardiac rehabilitation', 'Depression', 'Physical activity']",General hospital psychiatry,10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2017.05.001,2017-11-11,"[{'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'Patrick J', 'initials': 'PJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, United States.

29052928,Jung et al.,Relationship between physical activity levels and depressive symptoms in community-dwelling older Japanese adults.,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between physical activity (PA) and depressive symptoms in community-dwelling older Japanese adults.
A cross-sectional study design was used to obtain data from 3191 community-dwelling older Japanese adults aged 70-95 years. Depressive symptoms were assessed using self-reported scores on the Geriatric Depression Scale-15. PA was objectively measured using an accelerometer worn for a maximum of 40 days, and average daily durations of light-intensity PA (LPA), moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA (MVPA) and step count were calculated. PA was compared between participants with and without depressive symptoms by carrying out analysis of covariance and multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for all covariates by using propensity scores.
Depressive symptoms were present in 598 participants (19.6%). A comparison of propensity-score adjusted PA showed that step count (5059.6 ± 53.7 vs 5003.0 ± 112.1 count/day; P = 0.652) and moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA duration (23.0 ± 0.4 vs 23.8 ± 0.7 min/day; P = 0.358) were not significantly different between participants with and without depressive symptoms, respectively. However, participants without depressive symptoms had a significantly higher LPA duration than those with depressive symptoms (39.4 ± 0.3 vs 37.3 ± 0.7 min/day, respectively; P < 0.01).

A cross-sectional research design.
Community geriatric women in Illan County, Taiwan.
Of note 216 participants, 65 years and older with full mobility, independent and able to communicate in Mandarin or Taiwanese Hokkien.
An average weekly physical activity score International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF) and Taiwan Geriatric Depression Scale. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was used to perform decision analysis.
The average IPAQ-SF score for the 216 participants was 9109.52. When an IPAQ-SF score of 4452 or below was obtained by participants, 38% of them encountered depression-like syndromes, regardless of their frailty status. Diabetes, high risk of metabolic syndrome and lower education were the risk factors found to cause depression among participants with low physical activity levels.
As women have a longer life expectancy and experience twice the rates of depression of men particularly after menopause, healthcare providers should emphasize exercise and lifestyle changes in order to improve the quality of health in geriatric women.","['depression', 'frailty', 'geriatric women', 'healthcare quality']",International journal for quality in health care : journal of the International Society for Quality in Health Care,10.1093/intqhc/mzx101,2017-10-13,"[{'lastname': 'Hwa Hsu', 'firstname': 'Ching', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Division of Cardiology, Heart Center, Cheng Hsin General Hospital, No. 45, Cheng Hsin St. Pei-Tou, Taipei 11217, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Tung', 'firstname': 'Heng-Hsin', 'initials': 'HH', 'affiliation': 'National Taipei University of Nursing and Health Science, 365 Ming Te Road, PeiTou, Taipei 112, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Clinciu', 'firstname': 'Daniel L', 'initials': 'DL', 'affiliation': 'National Chi Nan University, Puli, Taiwan.\nGraduate Institute of Biomedical Science, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Liang-Kung', 'initials': 'LK', 'affiliation': 'Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, No. 201, Sec. 2, Shi-Pai Road, Taipei 11217, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yin', 'firstname': 'Wei-Hsian', 'initials': 'WH', 'affiliation': 'Division of Cardiology, Heart Center, Cheng Hsin General Hospital, No. 45, Cheng Hsin St. Pei-Tou, Taipei 11217, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Iqbal', 'firstname': 'Usman', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Tsae-Jyy', 'initials': 'TJ', 'affiliation': 'National Taipei University of Nursing and Health Science, 365 Ming Te Road, PeiTou, Taipei 112, Taiwan.'}]",29024954,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Int J Qual Health Care"""

We aimed to further elucidate the association between HRR-1 and known psychosocial risk factors in patients referred for comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation. We examined 521 patients with coronary heart disease in the first week of an outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and positive (PA) and negative affect were rated with the Global Mood Scale. Depressive symptoms showed a significant inverse relationship with HRR-1 (p < .05), controlling for sociodemographic and medical covariates, whereas anxiety symptoms did not show a significant association. PA made a significant contribution to HRR-1 as well (p < .05). Our findings suggest an independent association between HRR-1 and psychosocial risk factors of CVD.","['Anxiety symptoms', 'Cardiovascular disease', 'Depressive symptoms', 'Heart rate recovery', 'Positive affect', 'Psychosocial risk factors']",Journal of clinical psychology in medical settings,10.1007/s10880-017-9511-1,2017-10-05,"[{'lastname': 'Stauber', 'firstname': 'Stefanie', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Division of Psychosomatic Medicine, Department of Neurology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, 3010, Bern, Switzerland. stefanie.stauber@insel.ch.'}, {'lastname': 'Rohrbach', 'firstname': 'Tina', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Thun Hospital, Thun, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Saner', 'firstname': 'Hugo', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Preventive Cardiology and Sports Medicine, Swiss Cardiovascular Centre, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Schmid', 'firstname': 'Jean Paul', 'initials': 'JP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cardiology, Clinic Barmelweid, Barmelweid, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Grolimund', 'firstname': 'Johannes', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Division of Psychosomatic Medicine, Department of Neurology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, and University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'von Känel', 'firstname': 'Roland', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychosomatic Medicine, Clinic Barmelweid, 5017, Barmelweid, Switzerland.'}]","28975490

28931449,Ribeiro et al.,Frailty and depression in centenarians.,"Physical frailty and depression are common comorbid conditions that have important impact on older adults. Few studies however have examined their co-occurrence in centenarians. This paper explores the relationship between the two conditions and the most characteristic depressive symptoms associated with the frailty syndrome.
Data come from two Portuguese Centenarian Studies. Frailty was measured using Fried's phenotype, which includes at least three clinical signs: exhaustion, weight loss, weakness, slowness, and low physical activity level; the Geriatric Depression Scale was used to assess depression. Descriptive comparison and binary logistic regression models were used for data analysis.
The final sample comprised 91 centenarians (mean age = 101.0, SD = 1.3; 85.7% female). From these, 5.5% were classified as robust, 42.9% as pre-frail, and 51.6% as frail. The prevalence of depression in the whole sample was 35.2% (51.1% in frail centenarians; 21.1% in pre-frail centenarians; 0% in robust centenarians). Frail centenarians presented higher risk of depression (OR = 3.92; 95% CI 1.48-10.4) when compared to pre-frail centenarians. Findings from the multivariable model (gender, living arrangements, education, cognition, subjective health, current illness, and functionality) revealed that only subjective health remained significant.
It seems that depression is a comorbid clinical independent condition that is frequent in frail and pre-frail centenarians.","['centenarians', 'depression', 'frailty phenotype', 'geriatric depression scale']",International psychogeriatrics,10.1017/S1041610217001910,2017-09-22,"[{'lastname': 'Ribeiro', 'firstname': 'Oscar', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'UnIFai and CINTESIS.ICBAS,University of Porto,Porto;ISSSP,Porto;University of Aveiro,Aveiro,Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Duarte', 'firstname': 'Natália', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'UnIFai.ICBAS,University of Porto,Porto,Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Teixeira', 'firstname': 'Laetitia', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'UnIFai and CINTESIS.ICBAS and ISPUP-EPIUnit,University of Porto,Porto,Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Paúl', 'firstname': 'Constança', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'UnIFai and CINTESIS.ICBAS,University of Porto,Porto,Portugal.'}]",28931449,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Int Psychogeriatr"""
28841238,Uemura et al.,Behavioral protective factors of increased depressive symptoms in community-dwelling older adults: A prospective cohort study.,"It remains unclear what kinds of behavior prevent the development of geriatric depression. This study aimed to elucidate behavioral predictors of increased depressive symptoms in older adults focusing on gender differences.
A total of 3106 community-dwelling older people aged older than or equal to 65 years without depressive symptoms at baseline participated. The 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale was used to assess depressive symptoms with a score of 6 or more at baseline and 15 month follow-up. Behavioral status was investigated by using dichotomous questions about the aspects of physical, cognitive, and social activities. Each category included 3 specific items. Demographic data and other potential confounding factors were also assessed.
In the 15 month follow-up survey, 239 participants (7.7%) reported increased depressive symptoms. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that engagement in light physical exercise (odds ratio = 0.74, 95%, CI = 0.56-0.98), taking enrichment lessons (0.62, 0.46-0.85), using a personal computer (0.68, 0.48-0.97), participation in events at the community center (0.54, 0.40-0.72), and attending a community meeting (0.69, 0.52-0.92) were independently associated with lower risk of increased depressive symptoms. In a separate analysis for each gender, significant odds ratios of using a personal computer were observed in men, whereas significant odds ratios of light physical exercise, participation in events at the community center, and attending a community meeting were observed in women.
Light physical exercise, taking lessons, usage of a computer, and participation in community events showed protective effects against depressive symptoms. However, the significance of each behavioral factor may vary according to gender.","['cognitive activity', 'depression', 'lifestyle', 'physical activity', 'social activity']",International journal of geriatric psychiatry,10.1002/gps.4776,2017-08-26,"[{'lastname': 'Uemura', 'firstname': 'Kazuki', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Liberal Arts and Sciences, Toyama Prefectural University, Imizu, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Makizako', 'firstname': 'Hyuma', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical Therapy, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan.\nDepartment of Preventive Gerontology, Center for Gerontology and Social Science, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Obu, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Sangyoon', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Preventive Gerontology, Center for Gerontology and Social Science, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Obu, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Doi', 'firstname': 'Takehiko', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Preventive Gerontology, Center for Gerontology and Social Science, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Obu, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Songchul', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Preventive Gerontology, Center for Gerontology and Social Science, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Obu, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Tsutsumimoto', 'firstname': 'Kota', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Preventive Gerontology, Center for Gerontology and Social Science, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Obu, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Shimada', 'firstname': 'Hiroyuki', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Preventive Gerontology, Center for Gerontology and Social Science, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Obu, Japan.'}]",28841238,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,DENIED: Wiley E Publisher says no to https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gps.4776/pdf
28838226,Rhee et al.,Intradialytic exercise improves physical function and reduces intradialytic hypotension and depression in hemodialysis patients.,"As numbers of maintenance hemodialysis patients are growing, debilitating conditions of muscle wasting and atrophy are becoming some of the greatest concerns in end-stage renal disease patients. Exercise training has various potential benefits in terms of prevention of a sustained decline in functional status. This study aimed to evaluate the physical, psychological, laboratory, and dialysis-related effects of intradialytic exercise.
We enrolled 22 patients from a hemodialysis center for a 6-month non-randomized prospective trial. Combination of aerobic exercise with bicycle ergometer and anaerobic exercise with elastic bands was conducted during hemodialysis. Data including physical fitness test results, dialysis-related measurements, and biochemical laboratory results were collected at baseline, 3, and 6 months. Depression and quality of life were assessed using Beck Depression Inventory and Short Form-36 health survey.
After exercise completion, there were significant improvements in back muscle power, forward and backward trunk flexibility, vertical jump, elbow flexion, sit to stand test, and 6-minute walk test (p < 0.05). No significant changes were observed in dry weight, blood pressure, Kt/V, and biochemical variables, except for intradialytic hypotension (p < 0.05). For depression, Beck Depression Inventory showed statistically significant enhancement (p < 0.05). Scores of Short Form-36 health survey did not show significant increase in each domain, except for bodily pain (p < 0.05).
Combined aerobic and anaerobic exercise training during dialysis was found to be effective on physical health status, intradialytic hypotension, and depression in terms of mental health. Therefore, the findings of the current study may provide an appropriate guidance for encouraging exercise by nephrologists.","['Depression', 'Intradialytic exercise', 'Intradialytic hypotension', 'Physical function', 'Renal dialysis']",The Korean journal of internal medicine,10.3904/kjim.2017.020,2017-08-26,"[{'lastname': 'Rhee', 'firstname': 'So Yon', 'initials': 'SY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hallym University Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Song', 'firstname': 'Jin Kyung', 'initials': 'JK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hallym University Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Hong', 'firstname': 'Suk Chul', 'initials': 'SC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hallym University Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Choi', 'firstname': 'Jae Won', 'initials': 'JW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hallym University Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Jeon', 'firstname': 'Hee Jung', 'initials': 'HJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hallym University Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Shin', 'firstname': 'Dong Ho', 'initials': 'DH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hallym University Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Ji', 'firstname': 'Eun Hee', 'initials': 'EH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Hallym University Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Choi', 'firstname': 'Eun-Hee', 'initials': 'EH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Hallym University Chuncheon Sacred Heart Hospital, Chuncheon, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Jiyeon', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Sports and Leisure, Sungshin University, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Aram', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Sports and Leisure, Sungshin University, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Choi', 'firstname': 'Seung Wook', 'initials': 'SW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Sports and Leisure, Sungshin University, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Oh', 'firstname': 'Jieun', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hallym University Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital, Seoul, Korea.'}]","28838226

28826716,Adogwa et al.,"Relationship Among Koenig Depression Scale and Postoperative Outcomes, Ambulation, and Perception of Pain in Elderly Patients (≥65 Years) Undergoing Elective Spinal Surgery for Adult Scoliosis.","The aim of this study was to assess whether the Koenig Depression Scale (KDS) can identify depressed elderly patients undergoing elective spine surgery for deformity at risk for inferior postoperative outcomes including complication rates, ambulation ability, and patient-reported outcomes.
The medical records of 92 elderly patients (≥65 years) undergoing a planned elective spinal surgery for correction of adult degenerative scoliosis were reviewed for this study. Preoperative baseline depression was assessed using the validated KDS that was administered by a board-certified geriatrician. KDS is made up of 11 questions with a maximum of 11 points (No-Depression = KDS <4, Depression = KDS ≥4). The primary outcomes of this study were complication rates, duration of hospital stay, ambulation ability, and follow-up visual analog scale (VAS) scores at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after hospital discharge.
Of the 92 patients, 20 of them (21.7%) were found to have a KDS ≥4. Baseline demographics and comorbidities were similar between both cohorts. Intraoperative variables and complications were similar between both cohorts. There were no significant differences in postoperative complications including length of hospital stay. There was no significant difference in ambulation abilities including preoperative gait speed (P = 0.38), days from operation to ambulation (P = 0.86), steps on first day of ambulation (P = 0.57), and steps before hospital discharge (P = 0.35). There was no significant difference between the cohorts in VAS scores at baseline (P = 0.19), 6 weeks (P = 0.91), 3 months (P = 0.58), and 6 months (P = 0.97) after hospital discharge.

Among the sedentary, in spite of there not being an association between total resilience and mental health, there was an inverse relationship for the ""meaning of life"" component of the resilience and depression scale. For the active group, there was a relationship between total resilience and its components with depression and stress, but not for the ""meaning of life"" component of the resilience scale. Physical activity played an important role in the relationship between resilience and depression, showing that active and sedentary people use different components of resilience.","['anxiety', 'depression', 'older adults', 'physical exercise', 'resilience', 'stress']",Journal of aging and physical activity,10.1123/japa.2016-0332,2017-07-18,"[{'lastname': 'Wermelinger Ávila', 'firstname': 'Maria Priscila', 'initials': 'MP', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Corrêa', 'firstname': 'Jimilly Caputo', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lucchetti', 'firstname': 'Alessandra Lamas Granero', 'initials': 'ALG', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lucchetti', 'firstname': 'Giancarlo', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}]",28714789,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""J Aging Phys Act"""
28702757,Kazukauskiene et al.,Mental Distress Factors and Exercise Capacity in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease Attending Cardiac Rehabilitation Program.,"There is still insufficient data on mental distress factors contributing to exercise capacity (EC) improvement before and after cardiac rehabilitation (CR) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The aim of our study was to evaluate the associations between various mental distress factors and EC before and after exercise-based CR (EBCR).
Over 12 months, 223 CAD patients (70% men, mean age 58 ± 9 years) were evaluated for socio-demographic, clinical, and mental distress symptoms as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Patients were tested for EC at baseline and after EBCR.
In a multivariate linear regression model, EC before EBCR was associated with HADS anxiety subscale (β = -.186, p = .002) and BDI-II somatic/affective subscale (β = -.249, p < .001). EC after EBCR was associated with HADS anxiety and depression subscales (β = -.198, p < .001; β = -.170, p = .002, respectively) and BDI-II (β = -.258, p < .001). The BDI-II somatic/affective subscale was the best predictor of reduced EC before and after EBCR.
Mental distress and somatic/affective symptoms of depression are strongly associated with EC both at the beginning and after EBCR. Analysis of possible mediating or moderating factors was beyond the scope of our study. Future studies should focus on comprehensive evaluation of EC risk factors including other mental distress characteristics, subjectively experienced fatigue, and post-operative CAD symptoms.","['Anxiety', 'Cardiac rehabilitation', 'Coronary artery disease', 'Depression', 'Exercise capacity']",International journal of behavioral medicine,10.1007/s12529-017-9675-y,2017-07-14,"[{'lastname': 'Kazukauskiene', 'firstname': 'Nijole', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Behavioral Medicine Institute, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Vyduno al. 4, LT-00135, Palanga, Lithuania.'}, {'lastname': 'Burkauskas', 'firstname': 'Julius', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Behavioral Medicine Institute, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Vyduno al. 4, LT-00135, Palanga, Lithuania. julius.burkauskas@lsmuni.lt.'}, {'lastname': 'Macijauskiene', 'firstname': 'Jurate', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Nursing, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, A.

28699000,Rantakokko et al.,Nature diversity and well-being in old age.,"The research aim was to study the associations of nature diversity with quality of life (QoL) and depressive symptoms among older people, and whether physical activity explains the associations.
Community-dwelling people aged 75-90 years (n = 848) living in Central Finland were interviewed in their homes. QoL was assessed with a short version of the World Health Organization Quality-of-Life Assessment (range 0-130, higher score indicates better QoL) and depressive symptoms with the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (range 0-30, higher scores indicate more depressive symptoms). Self-reported physical activity was assessed by intensity and duration using a single question with seven response options ranging from mostly resting to competitive sports. Nature diversity (Shannon Diversity Index) was assessed objectively within a 500-m buffer around participants' homes using a geographic information system (GIS).
Mean QoL was 100.3 (SD 11.8) and mean CES-D 9.6 (SD 6.8). Those in the highest nature diversity tertile had better QoL than those in the lowest tertile (p = .022). Physical activity did not explain the association between nature diversity and QoL. Adjustment for health indicators did not change the results. Nature diversity was not associated with depressive symptoms.
A diverse environment, especially when this includes elements of nature, is associated with better QoL. Good quality of the green infrastructure and adding natural elements to residential areas may enhance well-being among community-dwelling older people.","['Aging', 'Depression', 'Diversity', 'Environment', 'Nature', 'Quality of life']",Aging clinical and experimental research,10.1007/s40520-017-0797-5,2017-07-13,"[{'lastname': 'Rantakokko', 'firstname': 'Merja', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Sport and Health Sciences, Gerontology Research Center, University of Jyvaskyla, P.O.

28672325,Deshpande et al.,Association of Playing High School Football With Cognition and Mental Health Later in Life.,"American football is the largest participation sport in US high schools and is a leading cause of concussion among adolescents. Little is known about the long-term cognitive and mental health consequences of exposure to football-related head trauma at the high school level.
To estimate the association of playing high school football with cognitive impairment and depression at 65 years of age.
A representative sample of male high school students who graduated from high school in Wisconsin in 1957 was studied. In this cohort study using data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, football players were matched between March 1 and July 1, 2017, with controls along several baseline covariates such as adolescent IQ, family background, and educational level. For robustness, 3 versions of the control condition were considered: all controls, those who played a noncollision sport, and those who did not play any sport.
Athletic participation in high school football.
A composite cognition measure of verbal fluency and memory and attention constructed from results of cognitive assessments administered at 65 years of age. A modified Center for Epidemiological Studies' Depression Scale score was used to measure depression. Secondary outcomes include results of individual cognitive tests, anger, anxiety, hostility, and heavy use of alcohol.
Among the 3904 men (mean [SD] age, 64.4 [0.8] years at time of primary outcome measurement) in the study, after matching and model-based covariate adjustment, compared with each control condition, there was no statistically significant harmful association of playing football with a reduced composite cognition score (-0.04 reduction in cognition vs all controls; 97.5% CI, -0.14 to 0.05) or an increased modified Center for Epidemiological Studies' Depression Scale depression score (-1.75 reduction vs all controls; 97.5% CI, -3.24 to -0.26). After adjustment for multiple testing, playing football did not have a significant adverse association with any of the secondary outcomes, such as the likelihood of heavy alcohol use at 65 years of age (odds ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.32-1.43).
Cognitive and depression outcomes later in life were found to be similar for high school football players and their nonplaying counterparts from mid-1950s in Wisconsin. The risks of playing football today might be different than in the 1950s, but for current athletes, this study provides information on the risk of playing sports today that have a similar risk of head trauma as high school football played in the 1950s.",[],JAMA neurology,"10.1001/jamaneurol.2017.1317

28668539,Eswaran et al.,"A Diet Low in Fermentable Oligo-, Di-, and Monosaccharides and Polyols Improves Quality of Life and Reduces Activity Impairment in Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Diarrhea.","We investigated the effects of a diet low in fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) vs traditional dietary recommendations on health-related quality of life (QOL), anxiety and depression, work productivity, and sleep quality in patients with irritable bowel syndrome and diarrhea (IBS-D).
We conducted a prospective, single-center, single-blind trial of 92 adult patients with IBS-D (65 women; median age, 42.6 years) randomly assigned to groups placed on a diet low in FODMAPs or a modified diet recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (mNICE) for 4 weeks. IBS-associated QOL (IBS-QOL), psychosocial distress (based on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), work productivity (based on the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment), and sleep quality were assessed before and after diet periods.
Eighty-four patients completed the study (45 in the low-FODMAP group and 39 in the mNICE group). At 4 weeks, patients on the diet low in FODMAPs had a larger mean increase in IBS-QOL score than did patients on the mNICE diet (15.0 vs 5.0; 95% CI, -17.4 to -4.3). A significantly higher proportion of patients in the low-FODMAP diet group had a meaningful clinical response, based on IBS-QOL score, than in the mNICE group (52% vs 21%; 95% CI, -0.52 to -0.08). Anxiety scores decreased in the low-FODMAP diet group compared with the mNICE group (95% CI, 0.46-2.80). Activity impairment was significantly reduced with the low-FODMAP diet (-22.89) compared with the mNICE diet (-9.44; 95% CI, 2.72-24.20).
In a randomized, controlled trial, a diet low in FODMAPs led to significantly greater improvements in health-related QOL, anxiety, and activity impairment compared with a diet based on traditional recommendations for patients with IBS-D.

28602061,Lee et al.,Factors associated with low-level physical activity in elderly patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the extent of physical activity (PA) is correlated with disease severity and prognosis. However, factors associated with low-level PA in elderly COPD patients are not known. We assessed the levels of PA and clinical factors associated with low-level of PA in elderly COPD patients.
This was a secondary analysis of a multicenter, prospective study of 245 patients with COPD. Among them, 160 patients with 65 years or more were included. Three PA groups were defined with respect to daily activity time (low, moderate, and high). Health related quality of life (HRQL) was measured using St. George's respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ) and 36-item short-form health survey. Anxiety and depression status were assessed employing the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS). Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify independent predictors of low-level PA in elderly COPD patients.
Of all the 160 patients, 103 (64.4%) engaged in low-level PA. Upon univariate analysis, a decreased exercise capacity (6-minute walk test < 250 m), an increased dyspnea (the modified medical research council [MMRC] dyspnea scale ≥ 2), a decreased HRQL (total SGRQ score), and a presence of depression (HADS-D ≥ 8) were significantly associated with low-level PA. Upon multivariate analysis, an MMRC grade ≥ 2 (hazard ratio [HR], 2.550; 
Two-thirds of elderly patients with COPD reported low-level of PA. More severe dyspnea and a presence of depression were independently associated with low-level PA in elderly COPD patients.","['Aged', 'Depression', 'Dyspnea', 'Pulmonary disease, chronic obstructive']",The Korean journal of internal medicine,10.3904/kjim.2016.090,2017-06-13,"[{'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Sang Hee', 'initials': 'SH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Wonkwang University Sanbon Hospital, Gunpo, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Ki Uk', 'initials': 'KU', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Busan, Korea.\nMedical Research Institute, Pusan National University Hospital, Busan, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Haejung', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nursing, Pusan National University College of Nursing, Yangsan, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Yun Seong', 'initials': 'YS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Busan, Korea.\nMedical Research Institute, Pusan National University Hospital, Busan, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Min Ki', 'initials': 'MK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Busan, Korea.\nMedical Research Institute, Pusan National University Hospital, Busan, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Park', 'firstname': 'Hye-Kyung', 'initials': 'HK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Busan, Korea.\nMedical Research Institute, Pusan National University Hospital, Busan, Korea.'}]","28602061

28532395,Zhang et al.,Factors associated with hand joint destruction in Chinese patients with rheumatoid arthritis.,"There have been no previous report of hand joint destruction prevalence in Chinese rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and potential factors of hand joint destruction among RA patients from Nantong China. In addition, we wanted to examine the differences between functional capacity, psychological status, and quality of life in patients with hand joint destruction compared to those without hand joint destruction.
A cross-sectional study was conducted from the Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University between July 2015 and June 2016. RA patients completed questionnaires for demographic or clinical variables, the 10-cm Visual Analog Scale for pain, the 28-joint Disease Activity Score-erythrocyte sedimentation rate for disease activity, the Health Assessment Questionnaire-disability index for physical function, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale for anxiety and depression, and the Short Form 36 health survey for quality of life. Laboratory examinations were taken to obtain some biochemical indicators (e.g., rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody). X-ray assessment of hand was performed and hand joint destruction was defined as Sharp score > 0. Independent sample t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, Chi-square test, and multivariate analysis using backward stepwise logistic regression model were used to analyze these data.
One hundred and sixty-one RA patients were included in this study. Radiographic findings revealed that almost 47.2% (n = 76) of patients had hand joint destruction. Multivariate analysis found that education ≤ 9 years (p = 0.041), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody positive (p = 0.021), high disease activity (p = 0.020), and long disease duration (p < 0.001) were important potential risk factors of hand joint destruction. Participants with hand joint destruction tended to have lower physical function and quality of life, and more severe depressive symptoms compared to individuals without hand joint destruction.
47.2% of people with RA from Nantong China experienced hand joint destruction. Education, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, disease activity, and disease duration had great impacts on hand joint destruction. The results suggested that rheumatologists should pay attention to RA patients' hand joint destruction, especially those with low education levels, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody positive, high disease activity, and long disease duration by patient education or other ways to improve patients' prognosis.","['Disease activity', 'Hand joint destruction', 'Quality of life', 'Rheumatoid arthritis']",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,"10.1186/s12891-017-1548-7

The current study aimed to assess the longitudinal association between physical activity and risk of seven categories of comorbidity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. The study included 409 patients from primary care practice in the Netherlands and Switzerland. We assessed physical activity using the Longitudinal Ageing Study Amsterdam Physical Activity Questionnaire at baseline and followed patients for up to 5 years. During follow-up, patients reported their comorbidities (cardiovascular, neurological, endocrine, musculoskeletal, malignant, and infectious diseases) and completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaire for mental health assessment. We implemented multinomial logistic regression (an approximation to discrete time survival model using death as a competing risk) for our analysis. Study results did not suggest a statistically significant association of baseline physical activity with the development of seven categories of comorbidity. However, when we focused on depression and anxiety symptoms, we found that higher levels of physical activity at baseline were associated with a lower risk for depression (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.85; 0.75-0.95; p = 0.005) and anxiety (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.89; 0.79-1.00; p = 0.045). In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients, those with high physical activity are less likely to develop depression or anxiety symptoms over time. Increasing physical activity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients may be an approach for testing to lower the burden from incident depression and anxiety.
STAY ACTIVE TO AVOID DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY: Patients with chronic lung disease who stay physically active could reduce their chances of depression and anxiety. Milo Puhan at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, and co-workers assessed the association between physical activity and the risk of developing various co-existing diseases in 409 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Co-morbidities such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and depression are prevalent in patients with COPD, but the reasons why are not clear. Puhan's team assessed patients' activity levels using an existing questionnaire, and administered another questionnaire to assess mental health. They followed the cohort for 5 years. Results indicated weak associations between physical activity levels and most physical illnesses, but there were significant links between higher levels of physical activity and a reduced risk of depression and anxiety. The results could inform novel COPD treatment programs.",[],NPJ primary care respiratory medicine,"10.1038/s41533-017-0034-x

28489319,Holmquist et al.,Low physical activity as a key differentiating factor in the potential high-risk profile for depressive symptoms in older adults.,"The identification of potential high-risk groups for depression is of importance. The purpose of the present study was to identify high-risk profiles for depressive symptoms in older individuals, with a focus on functional performance.
The population-based Healthy Ageing Initiative included 2,084 community-dwelling individuals (49% women) aged 70. Explorative cluster analysis was used to group participants according to functional performance level, using measures of basic mobility skills, gait variability, and grip strength. Intercluster differences in depressive symptoms (measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale [GDS]-15), physical activity (PA; measured objectively with the ActiGraph GT3X+), and a rich set of covariates were examined.
The cluster analysis yielded a seven-cluster solution. One potential high-risk cluster was identified, with overrepresentation of individuals with GDS scores >5 (15.1 vs. 2.7% expected; relative risk = 6.99, P < .001); the prevalence of depressive symptoms was significantly lower in the other clusters (all P < .01). The potential high-risk cluster had significant overrepresentations of obese individuals (39.7 vs. 17.4% expected) and those with type 2 diabetes (24.7 vs. 8.5% expected), and underrepresentation of individuals who fulfilled the World Health Organization's PA recommendations (15.6 vs. 59.1% expected; all P < .01), as well as low levels of functional performance.
The present study provided a potential high-risk profile for depressive symptoms among elderly community-dwelling individuals, which included low levels functional performance combined with low levels of PA. Including PA in medical screening of the elderly may aid in identification of potential high-risk individuals for depressive symptoms.","['depression', 'exercise', 'geriatric/aging/elderly', 'mood disorders', 'obesity']",Depression and anxiety,10.1002/da.22638,2017-05-11,"[{'lastname': 'Holmquist', 'firstname': 'Sofie', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Mattsson', 'firstname': 'Sabina', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden.\nSchool of Sport Sciences, UiT The Arctic University of Norway, Tromsø, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Schele', 'firstname': 'Ingrid', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Nordström', 'firstname': 'Peter', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Community Medicine and Rehabilitation, Geriatric Medicine, Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Nordström', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health and Clinical Medicine, Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden.'}]",28489319,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,DENIED: Wiley E Publisher says no to https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/da.22638/pdf

The physical and mental benefits of exercise are widely known but seldom available to persons suffering from Alzheimer's disease.
The aim of this study was to measure quality of life, systemic inflammation and psychological well-being response to aerobic exercises in Alzheimer's.
Forty Alzheimer elderly subjects were enrolled in two groups; the first group received treadmill aerobic exercise, while the second group was considered as a control group and received no training intervention for two months. Assessment of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES),Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Profile of Mood States(POMS) and SF-36 health quality of life (SF-36 HRQL) were taken before and at the end of the study.

28465305,Chang et al.,Effects of different amounts of exercise on preventing depressive symptoms in community-dwelling older adults: a prospective cohort study in Taiwan.,"To compare the effects of four different amounts of exercise for preventing depressive symptoms in community-dwelling older adults.
Prospective cohort study.
A nationally representative sample in Taiwan.
Four waves of the survey 'Taiwan Longitudinal Study on Aging (TLSA)' from 1996 to 2007 were analysed. A total of 2673 older adults aged 65 years and over were recruited.
Depressive symptoms were measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD). Four different types/amounts of exercise were examined including: (1) 3 times/week, 15 min/time; (2) 3 times/week, 30 min/time; (3) 6 times/week, 15 min/time; and (4) 6 times/week, 30 min/time. All exercise types were required to have at least moderate intensity. The impacts of different amounts of exercise on depressive symptoms were analysed using generalised linear mixed models.
More than one-fifth of the elder individuals under consideration had depressive symptoms (CESD ≥10). About 38.6% of older adults met the lowest criteria for exercise type 1, and fewer (28.0%) met the highest criteria for type 4. Only exercise type 4 in the current survey was initially related to lower depressive symptoms (OR=0.8, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.95). However, after considering the interaction between time and changes in exercise patterns, the results showed that all persistent exercise models, even if a very low amount (3 times/week, 15 min/time), had significantly preventive effects on depressive symptoms (OR=0.56~0.67).
Consistent exercise with at least 15 min per time, three times a week of moderate intensity is significantly associated with lower risk of depressive symptoms. This low amount of exercise may be easier to promote at the community and population level than other alternatives.

28422609,Rethorst et al.,Isotemporal Analysis of the Association of Objectively Measured Physical Activity With Depressive Symptoms: Results From Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL).,"The burden of depression among Hispanics/Latinos indicates the need to identify factors related to depressive symptoms. This paper examines the relationship of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) with depressive symptoms in Hispanic/Latinos.
The Hispanic Community Health Study / Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) is a population-based, cohort study of Hispanic/Latinos in 4 United States metropolitan areas. Objectively measured PA was coded into: sedentary behavior (SB), light-intensity (LPA), moderate-intensity (MPA), and vigorous-intensity (VPA); and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale-10 assessed depressive symptoms. Multiple regression analysis utilizing isotemporal substitution, adjusted for relevant covariates, examined PA as predictors of depressive symptoms.
Substitution of 1 hour of SB with VPA resulted in a significant decrease in depressive symptoms (β = -1.215, P = .021). Similar decreases were observed when VPA replaced LPA (β = -1.212, P = .021) and MPA (β = -1.50 P = .034). MPA and LPA were not associated with lower depressive symptoms.
Previous research has focused on the relationship of MVPA on depressive symptoms. Our results suggest these constructs should be examined separately as they may have unique relationships with depressive symptoms. The association of SB with greater depressive symptoms confirms previous reports.","['depression', 'exercise']",Journal of physical activity & health,"10.1123/jpah.2016-0648

28399803,"Britten, Addington, Astill",Dancing in time: feasibility and acceptability of a contemporary dance programme to modify risk factors for falling in community dwelling older adults.,"Falls are a common cause of injury in older adults, with the prevention of falls being a priority for public health departments around the world. This study investigated the feasibility, and impact of an 8 week contemporary dance programme on modifiable physical (physical activity status, mobility, sedentary behaviour patterns) and psychosocial (depressive state, fear of falling) risk factors for falls.
An uncontrolled 'pre-post' intervention design was used. Three groups of older (60 yrs.+) adults were recruited from local community groups to participate in a 3 separate, 8 week dance programmes. Each programme comprised two, 90 min dance classes per week. Quantitative measures of physical activity, sedentary behaviour, depression, mobility and fear of falling were measured at baseline (T1) and after 8 weeks of dance (T2). Weekly attendance was noted, and post-study qualitative work was conducted with participants in 3 separate focus groups. A combined thematic analysis of these data was conducted.
Of the 38 (Mean Age = 77.3 ± 8.4 yrs., 37 females) who attended the dance sessions, 22 (21 females; 1 male; mean age = 74.8, ±8.44) consented to be part of the study. Mean attendance was 14.6 (±2.6) sessions, and mean adherence was 84.3% (±17). Significant increases in moderate and vigorous physical activity were noted, with a significant decrease in sitting time over the weekdays (p < 0.05). Statistically significant decreases in the mean Geriatric Depression Scale (p < 0.05) and fear of falling (p < 0.005) score were noted, and the time taken to complete the TUG test decreased significantly from 10.1 s to 7.7 s over the 8 weeks (p < 0.005). Themes from the focus groups included the dance programme as a means of being active, health Benefits, and dance-related barriers and facilitators.
The recruitment of older adults, good adherence and favourability across all three sites indicate that a dance programme is feasible as an intervention, but this may be limited to females only. Contemporary dance has the potential to positively affect the physical activity, sitting behaviour, falls related efficacy, mobility and incidence of depression in older females which could reduce their incidence of falls. An adequately powered study with control groups are required to test this intervention further.","['Dance', 'Falls', 'Older adults', 'Physical activity']",BMC geriatrics,"10.1186/s12877-017-0476-6

28288563,Talarska et al.,Is independence of older adults safe considering the risk of falls?,"Falls affect approx. 30% of elderly population per year. They cause major injuries and reduce independence of the older adults' functioning. The main objective of the study was to evaluate the degree of independence and find the fall risk factors in the study group.
The study included 506 - older adults. The study group included patients from GP clinics and members of two senior centers. The study duration was 12 months. Our study tools included EASY- Care Standard 2010 questionnaire, Abbreviated Mental Test Score (AMTS), Index Barthel, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale (IADL), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Timed Up and Go (TUG).
The study included 357 (70.6%) female and 149 (29.4%) male subjects. The mean age of the study group patients was 75.7 years ± 8.0. Most of the older adult subjects were independent in both basic (Index Barthel) and instrumental (IADL) activities. Gait fluency evaluated in TUG scale found slow and unsteady gait in 33.7% of the subjects. 27.5% of the subjects used mobility aids when walking. In the Risk of falls scale, 131 subjects (25.89%) were at risk of falls. According to logistic regression the main risk of fall determinants (p <0.05) in the study group were: age, previous falls, feet problems, lack of regular care, impaired vision, urinary incontinence, pain, sleeping disorders, and lowered mood.
Risk of falls increases in people less independent in terms of basic and complex life activities and in people with depression. Most of the risk factors can be modified. It is necessary to develop a standard procedure aimed at preventing falls in the elderly.","['Elderly people', 'Falls', 'Life activities']",BMC geriatrics,"10.1186/s12877-017-0461-0

We sought to examine whether participation in group exercise and regular walking could mitigate the worsening of depressive symptoms among older survivors.
Prospective observational study.
Our baseline survey was conducted in August 2010, ∼7 months prior to the Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami, among people aged 65 or older residing in Iwanuma City, Japan, which suffered significant damage in the disaster. A 3-year follow-up survey was conducted in 2013.
3567 older survivors responded to the questionnaires predisaster and postdisaster.
Change in depressive symptoms was assessed using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).
From predisaster to postdisaster, the mean change in GDS score increased by 0.1 point (95% CI -0.003 to 0.207). During the same interval, the frequency of group exercise participation and daily walking time also increased by 1.9 days/year and 1.3 min/day, respectively. After adjusting for all covariates, including personal experiences of disaster, we found that increases in the frequency of group exercise participation (

28255746,"Ku, Steptoe, Chen",Prospective associations of exercise and depressive symptoms in older adults: the role of apolipoprotein E4.,"Exercise is associated with reduced risk of depressive symptoms at older ages, while recent work suggests that the apolipoprotein E type 4 allele (APOE-e4) may increase risk. There are no studies of whether APOE-e4 moderates the relationship between exercise and later life depressive symptoms. This study aimed to explore whether the prospective associations between exercise and subsequent depressive symptoms were distinct between APOE-e4 carriers and non-carriers using nationwide data.
Data from 639 participants (mean age = 66.14, SD = 7.26) in 2000 with 6 years of follow-up were studied. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale. Exercise and the APOE genotype were also assessed at baseline. Negative binomial regression models were conducted to examine the combined effects of exercise and APOE-e4 status on subsequent depressive symptoms when controlling for baseline depressive symptoms and other covariates. Sensitivity analyses to test for confounding, reverse causality, and attrition were conducted.
Among APOE-e4 carriers, there was no significant difference in depressive symptoms between high active and low active groups. In contrast, high active APOE-e4 non-carriers had fewer depressive symptoms than low active APOE-e4 non-carriers. The beneficial effect of exercise on depressive symptoms is restricted to APOE-e4 non-carriers. Sensitivity analyses provided further support for the robustness of these findings.
This is the first prospective study investigating whether APOE-e4 moderates the association between exercise and depressive symptoms. It proposes that genetic variation in APOE may influence the effect of exercise on depressive symptoms.","['Aging', 'Depression', 'Mental health', 'Moderation', 'Physical activity']","Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",10.1007/s11136-017-1537-1,2017-03-04,"[{'lastname': 'Ku', 'firstname': 'Po-Wen', 'initials': 'PW', 'affiliation': 'Graduate Institute of Sports and Health, National Changhua University of Education, Changhua, Taiwan, Republic of China.\nDepartment of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Steptoe', 'firstname': 'Andrew', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Li-Jung', 'initials': 'LJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London, London, UK. ljchen@ntupes.edu.tw.\nDepartment of Exercise Health Science, National Taiwan University of Sport, No. 271, Lixing Road, Taichung, 404, Taiwan, Republic of China. ljchen@ntupes.edu.tw.'}]","28255746

28195361,Veronese et al.,Frailty and incident depression in community-dwelling older people: results from the ELSA study.,"Frailty and pre-frailty are two common conditions in the older people, but whether these conditions could predict depression is still limited to a few longitudinal studies. In this paper, we aimed to investigate whether frailty and pre-frailty are associated with an increased risk of depression in a prospective cohort of community-dwelling older people.
Four thousand seventy-seven community-dwelling men and women over 60 years without depression at baseline were included from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Frailty status was defined according to modified Fried's criteria (weakness, weight loss, slow gait speed, low physical activity and exhaustion) and categorized as frailty (≥3 criteria), pre-frailty (1-2 criteria) or robustness (0 criterion). Depression was diagnosed as ≥4 out of 8 points of Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, after 2 years of follow-up.
Over a 2-year follow-up, 360 individuals developed depression. In a logistic regression analysis, adjusted for 18 potential baseline confounders, pre-frailty (odds ratio (OR) = 0.89; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.54-1.46; p = 0.64) and frailty (OR = 1.22; 95% CI, 0.90-1.64; p = 0.21) did not predict the onset of depression at follow-up. Among the criteria included in the frailty definition, only slow gait speed (OR = 1.82; 95% CI, 1.00-3.32; p = 0.05) appeared to predict a higher risk of depression.
Among older community dwellers, frailty and pre-frailty did not predict the onset of depression during 2 years of follow-up, when accounting for potential confounders, whilst slow gait speed considered alone may predict depression in the older people.

28187728,Zhang et al.,Community health service center-based cardiac rehabilitation in patients with coronary heart disease: a prospective study.,"Despite considerable efforts to encourage participation, even in some developed countries, proportion of patients participating in institution-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs remained sub-optimal. The present study was designed to investigate the acceptability of community health service center (CHSC)-based Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR), and examine its effectiveness in terms of changes in quality of life (QOL), psychological state and exercise capacity.
A consecutive series of eligible patients was recruited from the health registration system of two CHSCs in Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China. Patients in intervention site were provided with CR (CR-group) while patients in non-intervention site were offered the usual care (UC-group). Data regarding health-related QOL (HRQoL), psychological state and exercise capacity (6-min walk test = 6MWT) were collected and compared at baseline and at 6 months post-intervention.
Among invited patients eligible for CR program, 65.3% participated, while 5.3% of the participants dropped out during follow-up. Patients in CR-group showed significant decrease in the scores for anxiety and depression as per the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), along with marked increases in the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12)-based Physical (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores. Moreover, the measurement of 6MWT showed a significant increase of 57.42 m walking distance among CR patients in contrast with a slight increase among UC patients.
Given the high participation and low withdrawal along with considerable improvements in HRQoL, psychological state and exercise capacity, CHSC was likely to be the optimal setting for implementing CR for patients with CHD in China.

28181713,Ku et al.,Prospective relationship between objectively measured light physical activity and depressive symptoms in later life.,"The use of self-report measures of physical activity is a serious methodological weakness in many studies of physical activity and depressive symptoms. It is still equivocal whether light physical activity protects older adults from depressive symptoms.
This study aimed to explore whether objectively measured light physical activity, independent of sedentary and moderate-to-vigorous activity, is associated with a reduced risk of subsequent depressive symptoms in older adults.
This was a 2-year prospective cohort study. A total of 285 community-dwelling older adults aged 65 years or older were interviewed in 2012. A second wave of assessment was carried out in 2014 involving 274 (96.1%) participants. Time spent in physical activity at different intensities was assessed using triaxial accelerometers. Depressive symptoms were measured using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale. Negative binomial regression models with adjustment for baseline depressive symptoms, accelerometer wear time, socio-demographic variables, lifestyle behaviors, and chronic disease conditions were conducted.
Time spent in moderate-to-vigorous and light physical activities were both inversely related to depressive symptoms at follow-up. Sedentary time was associated with an increased risk of subsequent depressive symptoms. When sedentary or moderate-to-vigorous activity were included in the multivariable-adjusted regression models with light physical activity simultaneously, only light physical activity remained significant. Sensitivity analyses for assessing confounding and reverse causation provided further support for the stability of these findings.

28173690,Foscolou et al.,The Impact of the Financial Crisis on Lifestyle Health Determinants Among Older Adults Living in the Mediterranean Region: The Multinational MEDIS Study (2005-2015).,"By the end of the 2000s, the economic situation in many European countries started to deteriorate, generating financial uncertainty, social insecurity and worse health status. The aim of the present study was to investigate how the recent financial crisis has affected the lifestyle health determinants and behaviours of older adults living in the Mediterranean islands.
From 2005 to 2015, a population-based, multi-stage convenience sampling method was used to voluntarily enrol 2749 older adults (50% men) from 20 Mediterranean islands and the rural area of the Mani peninsula. Lifestyle status was evaluated as the cumulative score of four components (range, 0 to 6), that is, smoking habits, diet quality (MedDietScore), depression status (Geriatric Depression Scale) and physical activity.
Older Mediterranean people enrolled in the study from 2009 onwards showed social isolation and increased smoking, were more prone to depressive symptoms, and adopted less healthy dietary habits, as compared to their counterparts participating earlier in the study (p<0.05), irrespective of age, gender, several clinical characteristics, or socioeconomic status of the participants (an almost 50% adjusted increase in the lifestyle score from before 2009 to after 2009, p<0.001).
A shift towards less healthy behaviours was noticeable after the economic crisis had commenced. Public health interventions should focus on older adults, particularly of lower socioeconomic levels, in order to effectively reduce the burden of cardiometabolic disease at the population level.","['Health status', 'Lifestyle health determinant index', 'Mediterranean islands', 'Older adults', 'Socioeconomic status', 'Financial crisis']",Journal of preventive medicine and public health = Yebang Uihakhoe chi,"10.3961/jpmph.16.101

28129498,Baumeister et al.,"Associations of Leisure-Time and Occupational Physical Activity and Cardiorespiratory Fitness With Incident and Recurrent Major Depressive Disorder, Depressive Symptoms, and Incident Anxiety in a General Population.","Physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness may help prevent depression and anxiety. Previous studies have been limited by error-prone measurements. We examined whether self-reported physical activity domains and peak exercise capacity (peakVO₂) are associated with incident and recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD), depressive symptoms, and anxiety disorders.
This was a prospective population-based study of 1,080 adult men and women (25-83 years) with a median follow-up of 4.5 years and measures of physical activity during leisure time, sports, and work (Baecke questionnaire); a measure of depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory II); symptom-limited cycle ergometer testing (peakVO₂, oxygen uptake at anaerobic threshold [VO₂@AT], maximum power output at peak exertion); and a structured psychiatric interview (Munich Composite International Diagnostic Interview). Baseline data were collected between 2002 and 2006, and follow-up data, between 2007 and 2010.
After adjustment for age, sex, education, smoking, alcohol consumption, and waist circumference, the relative risks for incident MDD per standard deviation (SD) increase in leisure-time physical activity, physical activity during sport, physical activity at work, peakVO₂, VO₂@AT, and maximum power output were 1.002 (95% confidence interval, 0.90 to 1.12), 1.02 (0.90 to 1.15), 0.94 (0.80 to 1.10), 0.71 (0.52 to 0.98), 0.83 (0.66 to 1.04), and 0.71 (0.52 to 0.96), respectively. PeakVO₂, VO₂@AT, and maximum power output were associated with recurrent MDD, depressive symptoms, and anxiety. PeakVO₂ was more strongly related to the co-occurrence of MDD and anxiety (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.45 [0.24 to 0.84]) than depression or anxiety alone (OR = 0.71 [0.53 to 0.94]).
Greater cardiorespiratory fitness but not domain-specific physical activity was associated with a lower incidence of MDD and clinical anxiety.",[],The Journal of clinical psychiatry,10.4088/JCP.15m10474,2017-01-28,"[{'lastname': 'Baumeister', 'firstname': 'Sebastian E', 'initials': 'SE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, University of Regensburg, Franz-Josef-Strauß-Allee 11, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany. sebastian.baumeister@ukr.de.\nDepartment of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.\nInstitute for Community Medicine, University Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Leitzmann', 'firstname': 'Michael F', 'initials': 'MF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Bahls', 'firstname': 'Martin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine B, University Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.\nGerman Centre for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), Partner Site Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Dörr', 'firstname': 'Marcus', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine B, University Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.\nGerman Centre for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), Partner Site Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schmid', 'firstname': 'Daniela', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schomerus', 'firstname': 'Georg', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.\nHelios Hanseklinikum Stralsund, Stralsund, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Appel', 'firstname': 'Katja', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Markus', 'firstname': 'Marcello R P', 'initials': 'MR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine B, University Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.\nGerman Centre for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), Partner Site Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Völzke', 'firstname': 'Henry', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Community Medicine, University Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.\nGerman Centre for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), Partner Site Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Gläser', 'firstname': 'Sven', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine B, University Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.\nDepartment of Internal Medicine, District Hospital Demmin, Demmin, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Grabe', 'firstname': 'Hans-Jörgen', 'initials': 'HJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.'}]",28129498,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""J Clin Psychiatry"""

Besides socio-demographic data, depressive symptoms and quality of life were assessed by standardized procedures (Beck Depression Scale [BDI], SF 36 Quality of Life Questionnaire) before and after a ten-weeks lasting ""Physical Activity Program"", consisting of 10min warm-up activities, 20 mintes rhythmic exercices, 10min cool-down exercises and a 30 mintes free walking period on four days of the week.
In contast to controls, individuals of the intervention group presented with a significant decrease in the BDI after the ""Physical Activity Program"". Likewise, eight-subscales and two sub-dimensions of the SF 36 Quality of Life Questionnaire significantly improved only in the experimental group (p<0.05).
Our results suggest that a structured physical activity program positively impacts depressive symptoms and quality of life in elderly individuals.","['Depression', 'Elderly', 'Physical activity', 'Quality of life']",Archives of gerontology and geriatrics,10.1016/j.archger.2017.01.008,2017-01-23,"[{'lastname': 'Lok', 'firstname': 'Neslihan', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatric Nursing, Selçuk University Faculty of Health Sciences, Konya, Turkey.

28049272,Ohmori et al.,Associations between depression and unhealthy behaviours related to metabolic syndrome: a cross sectional study.,"The purpose of the present study was to determine whether depression was associated with metabolic syndrome and unhealthy behaviours in community residents.
Using the 2009-2010 baseline data of the Saku Cohort Study, 1,225 men and women who participated in a community health screening were included in the cross-sectional analyses. Depression was assessed using the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale. Consistent with the Japanese Society of Internal Medicine's definition, we defined metabolic syndrome as abdominal obesity plus two or more of the following: high blood pressure, hyperglycaemia, and dyslipidaemia. We defined 'pre- and metabolic syndrome' as the presence of one or more of the three criteria in addition to abdominal obesity.
There was no significant association between depression and metabolic syndrome. In women, the prevalence of pre- and metabolic syndrome was significantly higher in the depression group than that in the non-depression group (17.5% vs 9.5%, p=0.046), whereas no such significant association was observed in men. Logistic regression analysis showed that depression was associated with unhealthy behavioural factors differently in men and women.
This study revealed that depression was associated with several unhealthy behavioural factors in both men and women, but depression was associated with pre- and metabolic syndrome only in women. These findings suggest that depression may be a warning sign of metabolic syndrome in women with unhealthy behavioural factors. Psychological factors should be considered in addition to the assessment of physical status.",[],Asia Pacific journal of clinical nutrition,10.6133/apjcn.112015.01,2017-01-05,"[{'lastname': 'Ohmori', 'firstname': 'Yumi', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Social Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health, National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, Tokyo, Japan.

27808060,Behera et al.,Prevalence and determinants of depression among elderly persons in a rural community from northern India.,"Globally, more than 350 million people of all ages suffer from depression. Elderly persons are more vulnerable to depression. We conducted this study to estimate the prevalence of depression, and to study the association of depression with sociodemographic and clinical variables among elderly persons in a rural community.
We conducted a community-based cross-sectional study among 395 randomly selected elderly persons aged 60 years and above in a rural area of Ballabgarh, Haryana, India. The participants were screened by using the Geriatric Depression Scale, and diagnosis was confirmed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Multivariate analysis was done for independent predictors of depression.
The prevalence of depression was 11.4% (95% CI 8.6%-14.9%). Living in a nuclear family (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 8.98, 95% CI 3.40-23.71), lack of physical activity (AOR 4.95, 95% CI 2.00-12.27), whole-time involvement in household work (AOR 4.47, 95% CI 1.18-16.93), presence of two or more chronic diseases (AOR 4.45, 95% CI 1.60-12.35), having no role in family decision-making (AOR 2.77, 95% CI 1.19-6.42), sleep problems in past one year (AOR 2.97, 95% CI 1.32-6.69) and bilateral hearing impairment (AOR 4.00, 95% CI 1.80-8.88) were factors associated with depression in elderly persons.
Depression is common among elderly persons in rural areas.

27779573,McAdams-DeMarco et al.,Individual Frailty Components and Mortality in Kidney Transplant Recipients.,"Frailty increases early hospital readmission and mortality risk among kidney transplantation (KT) recipients. Although frailty represents a high-risk state for this population, the correlates of frailty, the patterns of the 5 frailty components, and the risk associated with these patterns are unclear.
Six hundred sixty-three KT recipients were enrolled in a cohort study of frailty in transplantation (12/2008-8/2015). Frailty, activities of daily living (ADL)/instrumental ADL (IADL) disability, Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale depression, education, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) were measured. We used multinomial regression to identify frailty correlates. We identified which patterns of the 5 components were associated with mortality using adjusted Cox proportional hazards models.
Frailty prevalence was 19.5%. Older recipients (adjusted prevalence ratio [PR], 2.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-4.07) were more likely to be frail. The only other factors that were independently associated with frailty were IADL disability (PR, 3.22; 95% CI, 1.72-6.06), depressive symptoms (PR, 11.31; 95% CI, 4.02-31.82), less than a high school education (PR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.30-7.36), and low HRQOL (fair/poor: PR, 3.71; 95% CI, 1.48-9.31). The most common pattern was poor grip strength, low physical activity, and slowed walk speed (19.4%). Only 2 patterns of the 5 components emerged as having an association with post-KT mortality. KT recipients with exhaustion and slowed walking speed (hazards ratio = 2.43; 95% CI, 1.17-5.03) and poor grip strength, exhaustion, and slowed walking speed (hazard ratio, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.14-5.97) were at increased mortality risk.
Age was the only conventional factor associated with frailty among KT recipients; however, factors rarely measured as part of clinical practice, namely, HRQOL, IADL disability, and depressive symptoms, were significant correlates of frailty. Redefining the frailty phenotype may be needed to improve risk stratification for KT recipients.",[],Transplantation,10.1097/TP.0000000000001546,2016-10-26,"[{'lastname': 'McAdams-DeMarco', 'firstname': 'Mara A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': '1 Department of Surgery, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD. 2 Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD. 3 Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD. 4 Department of Biostatistics, Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD.'}, {'lastname': 'Ying', 'firstname': 'Hao', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Olorundare', 'firstname': 'Israel', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'King', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth A', 'initials': 'EA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Haugen', 'firstname': 'Christine', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Buta', 'firstname': 'Brian', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gross', 'firstname': 'Alden L', 'initials': 'AL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kalyani', 'firstname': 'Rita', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Desai', 'firstname': 'Niraj M', 'initials': 'NM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Dagher', 'firstname': 'Nabil N', 'initials': 'NN', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lonze', 'firstname': 'Bonnie E', 'initials': 'BE', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Montgomery', 'firstname': 'Robert A', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bandeen-Roche', 'firstname': 'Karen', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Walston', 'firstname': 'Jeremy D', 'initials': 'JD', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Segev', 'firstname': 'Dorry L', 'initials': 'DL', 'affiliation': None}]","27779573

27698263,Sommer et al.,Changes in Health-Related Quality of Life During Rehabilitation in Patients With Operable Lung Cancer: A Feasibility Study (PROLUCA).,"Surgical resection in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) may be associated with significant morbidity, functional limitations, and decreased quality of life.
The objective is to present health-related quality of life (HRQoL) changes over time before and 1 year after surgery in patients with NSCLC participating in a rehabilitation program.
Forty patients with NSCLC in disease stage I to IIIa, referred for surgical resection at the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery RT, Rigshospitalet, were included in the study. The rehabilitation program comprised supervised group exercise program, 2 hours weekly for 12 weeks, combined with individual counseling. The study endpoints were self-reported HRQoL (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung, European Organization for Research and Treatment in Cancer-Quality of Life Questionnaire-QLQ-C30, Short-Form-36) and self-reported distress, anxiety, depression, and social support (National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support), measured presurgery, postintervention, 6 months, and 1 year after surgery.
Forty patients were included, 73% of whom completed rehabilitation. Results on emotional well-being ( P < .0001), global quality of life ( P = .0032), and mental health component score ( P = .0004) showed an overall statistically significant improvement during the study.
This feasibility study demonstrated that global quality of life, mental health, and emotional well-being improved significantly during the study, from time of diagnosis until 1 year after resection, in patients with NSCLC participating in rehabilitation.","['HRQoL', 'NSCLC', 'exercise', 'lung cancer', 'rehabilitation']",Integrative cancer therapies,"10.1177/1534735416668258

27354787,Dueñas-Espín et al.,Depression symptoms reduce physical activity in COPD patients: a prospective multicenter study.,"The role of anxiety and depression in the physical activity (PA) of patients with COPD is controversial. We prospectively assessed the effect of symptoms of anxiety and depression on PA in COPD patients.
We evaluated anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]), PA (Dynaport(®) accelerometer), and other relevant characteristics in 220 COPD patients from five European countries at baseline and at 6 and 12 months of follow-up. HADS score was categorized as: no symptoms (score 0-7), suggested (8-10), and probable (>11) anxiety or depression. We estimated the association between anxiety and depression at t (baseline and 6 months) and PA at t+1 (6 and 12 months) using regression models with a repeated measures approach.
Patients had a mean (standard deviation) age of 67 (8) years, forced expiratory volume in 1 second 57 (20)% predicted. At baseline, the prevalence of probable anxiety and depression was 10% and 5%, respectively. In multivariable models adjusted by confounders and previous PA, patients performed 81 fewer steps/day (95% confidence interval, -149 to -12, P=0.02) per extra point in HADS-depression score. HADS-anxiety symptoms were not associated with PA.
In COPD patients, symptoms of depression are prospectively associated with a measurable reduction in PA 6 months later.","['COPD', 'HADS', 'anxiety', 'depression', 'physical activity', 'prospective study']",International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,10.2147/COPD.S101459,2016-06-30,"[{'lastname': 'Dueñas-Espín', 'firstname': 'Iván', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': ""ISGlobal, Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology (CREAL), Barcelona, Spain; Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF), Barcelona, Spain; CIBEREpidemiología y Salud Pública (CIBERESP), Barcelona, Spain; Secretaría Nacional de Educación Superior, Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación del Ecuador (SENESCYT), Quito, Ecuador; Institut d'investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Demeyer', 'firstname': 'Heleen', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Gimeno-Santos', 'firstname': 'Elena', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'ISGlobal, Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology (CREAL), Barcelona, Spain; Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF), Barcelona, Spain; CIBEREpidemiología y Salud Pública (CIBERESP), Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Polkey', 'firstname': 'Michael I', 'initials': 'MI', 'affiliation': 'NIHR Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit at the Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust and Imperial College, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Hopkinson', 'firstname': 'Nicholas S', 'initials': 'NS', 'affiliation': 'NIHR Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit at the Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust and Imperial College, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Rabinovich', 'firstname': 'Roberto A', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': ""ELEGI Colt Laboratory, Centre for Inflammation Research, The Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Dobbels', 'firstname': 'Fabienne', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Academic Centre for Nursing and Midwifery, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Karlsson', 'firstname': 'Niklas', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Health Economics and Outcomes Research, AstraZeneca R&D, Mölndal, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Troosters', 'firstname': 'Thierry', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Department of Respiratory Diseases, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Garcia-Aymerich', 'firstname': 'Judith', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'ISGlobal, Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology (CREAL), Barcelona, Spain; Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF), Barcelona, Spain; CIBEREpidemiología y Salud Pública (CIBERESP), Barcelona, Spain.'}]","27354787

27291074,Sliwa et al.,Occupational Physical Activity and Weight-Related Outcomes in Immigrant Mothers.,"New immigrants are likely to be employed in occupations that provide physical activity; however, these positions may place workers at risk for adverse health outcomes. Relationships between occupational physical activity (OPA); weight-related behaviors; obesity; and depression remain underexplored among recent immigrants.
Participants (N=385) were Brazilian, Haitian, and Latino mothers enrolled in a community-based participatory research lifestyle intervention among immigrant mothers (<10 years in U.S.). Baseline BMI was calculated using objectively measured height and weight. Self-reported baseline data included sociodemographics; physical activity (Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire); depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale); and prepared food purchasing frequency. Logistic regression models estimated the odds of obesity (BMI ≥30.0); high depressive symptoms (score ≥16); and purchasing prepared foods (≥1 times/week) by OPA quartile. Models adjusted for covariates, including household composition, origin group, maternal age, education, household income, and recruitment year (2010, 2011). Data were analyzed in 2013.
Employed participants (49%) primarily worked as domestic workers, nursing assistants, and food service staff. In adjusted models, women in the highest OPA quartile versus lowest had 65% lower obesity odds (95% CI=0.16, 0.76) and approximately twice the odds of presenting high depressive symptoms (2.01, 95% CI=1.02, 4.27) and purchasing takeout food (1.85, 95% CI=0.90, 3.90), which was attenuated after adjusting for income and education (unadjusted OR=1.98, 95% CI=1.10, 3.52).
OPA contributes to energy expenditure and may protect against obesity among new immigrant mothers; however, it is also associated with high depressive symptoms.

One hundred ninety-five community-dwelling adults were interviewed using the Modified Reminiscence Functions Scale, Brief Pain Inventory, Life Orientation Test-Revised, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Short Depression Scale, and Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly in random counterbalanced order. Structural equation modeling supported chronic pain as positively associated with depressive symptoms and comorbidities and unrelated to physical activity. Depressive symptoms were positively associated with self-negative reminiscence and negatively associated with optimism. Spontaneous reminiscence was not associated with increased physical activity or reduced pain. Individuals may require facilitated integrative reminiscence to assist them in reinterpreting negative memories in a more positive way.

27183110,Ylli et al.,"Clinically relevant depression in old age: An international study with populations from Canada, Latin America and Eastern Europe.","Our aim is to assess cross-national variations in prevalence of clinically relevant depression and to examine the relationships of social and health factors with depression in five diverse populations of older adults, from Canada, Brazil, Colombia and Albania. We used the data from the International Mobility in Aging Study. Clinically relevant depression was defined as a score of ≥16 on the Center for Epidemiologic Study Depression Scale (CES-D). Poisson regressions with robust covariance correction were used to estimate prevalence ratios associated with potential risk factors. Prevalence of clinically relevant depression across research sites varied widely, being consistently higher in women than in men. It was lowest in men from Brazil (6.3%) and highest in women from Albania (46.6%). Low education and insufficient income, living alone, multiple chronic conditions, and poor physical performance were all significantly associated with depression prevalence. Poor physical performance was more strongly associated with depression in men than in women. Similar factors are associated with clinically relevant depression among men and women and across research sites. The large variation in depression prevalence population rates is unexplained by the classical individual factors considered in the study suggesting the impact of country characteristics on depression among older populations.","['Aging', 'Depression', 'Disability', 'Global health', 'Sex', 'Social factors']",Psychiatry research,10.1016/j.psychres.2016.04.096,2016-05-18,"[{'lastname': 'Ylli', 'firstname': 'Alban', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Public Health, Tirana, Albania; University of Medicine, Tirana, Albania.

27102790,Tanaka et al.,"A Comparison of Objective Physical Activity, Muscle Strength, and Depression among Community-dwelling Older Women Living in Sloped Versus Non-sloped Environments.","To examine the relationship between the living location and outcomes of physical activity level and physical and psychological functioning in older women. The specific aim was to understand the association between living in a sloped versus non-sloped environment and these outcomes.
Cross-sectional study.
108 older women aged 65 years or older who resided in Nagasaki prefecture participated.
Physical activity, lung function, muscle strength (hand grip and quadriceps force) and depressive symptoms were assessed objectively.
In logistic regression, activity counts per day (OR 0.779, 95%CI 0.715-0.841, p<0.01), activity times per day (OR 0.821, 95%CI 0.801-0.913, p<0.01), hand grip force (OR 0.666, 95%CI 0.558-0.796, p<0.001), and depressed (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale score ≥16) (OR 1.093, 95%CI 1.019-1.427, p<0.05) showed statistically significant inverse associations with living in a sloped ground.
Since dwelling on sloped ground was associated with negative (lower physical activity levels, lower grip strength, and more depression) outcomes, a comprehensive geriatric assessment, related to all aspects of older women, is recommended.

27002988,Kokkonen et al.,The functional capacity and quality of life of women with advanced breast cancer.,"The rehabilitation needs of patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) are poorly studied. The primary aim of the study was to evaluate the functional capacity of women with MBC and quality of life (QoL).
The present study is an open, non-randomized, prospective cross-sectional observation study. The functional capacity of 128 MBC patients with ongoing cancer treatments, were studied in Helsinki University Hospital (HUS): Peak expiratory flow (PEF), dynamic and static balance, 6 minute walking distance (6MWD), 10 meter walking, sit-to-stand test, repeated squat, grip strength, shoulder movement, pain, and QoL by Beck's depression scale (BDI), health assessment questionnaire (HAQ), RAND SF-36 and EORTC QLQ-30 items.
The walking capacity was compromised in half and the strength of the lower extremities in one-third of the patients. PEF was below the normal reference in 55 %, static balance in 62 % and dynamic balance in 73 % (≤60 year olds) and 81 % (≥61 year olds). The grip power was lowered in 44/30 % of the patients (right/left) and the shoulder movement was restricted in 30 %. Some disability in physical functioning experienced 55 % (HAQ) and 37 % felt depressive (BDI). The QoL (RAND SF-36) was poor especially in the field of physical, role and social functioning and bodily pain (<0.001). Pain, depression, and a poor 6MWD results independently determined the physical component of QoL (p < 0.001).
The functional capacity of patients with MBC was significantly lowered. This, in association with distressing symptoms like pain and depression causes a vicious circle further leading to functional disabilities and impaired QoL.","['Breast cancer', 'Disability', 'Metastatic', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation']","Breast cancer (Tokyo, Japan)",10.1007/s12282-016-0687-2,2016-03-24,"[{'lastname': 'Kokkonen', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland. kristiina.kokkonen@helsinki.fi.'}, {'lastname': 'Saarto', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Helsinki University Central Hospital, Cancer Center, University of Helsinki, P.O.

26872253,Dziubek et al.,The Level of Anxiety and Depression in Dialysis Patients Undertaking Regular Physical Exercise Training--a Preliminary Study.,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of a six-month physical training undertaken by haemodialysis (HD) patients, on the depression and anxiety.
Patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) were recruited from the dialysis station at the Department of Nephrology and Transplantation Medicine in Wroclaw. Physical training took place at the beginning of the first 4-hours of dialysis, three times a week for six months. A personal questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were used in the study.
A total of 28 patients completed the study: 20 were randomised to endurance training and 8 were randomised to resistance training. Statistical analysis of depression and anxiety at the initial (t1) and final examination (t2) indicated a significant reduction in depression and anxiety, particularly anxiety as a trait (X2) in the whole study group. The change in anxiety as a state correlated with the disease duration, duration of dialysis and the initial level of anxiety as a state (t1X1). The change in anxiety as a trait significantly correlated with age and the initial level of anxiety (t1X2).
Undertaking physical training during dialysis by patients with ESRD is beneficial in reducing their levels of anxiety and depression. Both resistance and endurance training improves mood, but only endurance training additionally results in anxiety reduction.",[],Kidney & blood pressure research,10.1159/000368548,2016-02-13,"[{'lastname': 'Dziubek', 'firstname': 'Wioletta', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiotherapy, University School of Physical Education, Wroclaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Kowalska', 'firstname': 'Joanna', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kusztal', 'firstname': 'Mariusz', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rogowski', 'firstname': 'Łukasz', 'initials': 'Ł', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gołębiowski', 'firstname': 'Tomasz', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Nikifur', 'firstname': 'Małgorzata', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Szczepańska-Gieracha', 'firstname': 'Joanna', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Zembroń-Łacny', 'firstname': 'Agnieszka', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Klinger', 'firstname': 'Marian', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Woźniewski', 'firstname': 'Marek', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}]",26872253,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,TXERROR: 403 status returned from Karger url (http://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/368548)

A total of 1465 people completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale in 2005 and were followed until death or 31 December 2010. Cox regression analyses compared survival time for people with a low v. high baseline dysphoria/anhedonia/anxiety score and identified mediating mechanisms.
After a mean follow-up of 1878 days (s.d. = 306), 139 participants had died. At all time points, people with anhedonia had an almost twofold increased mortality risk compared with those without anhedonia. Physical activity met criteria for mediation.

Patients with ischaemic heart failure and an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, willing to undergo an aerobic interval training programme. A total of 31 patients were enrolled (19 were assigned to the aerobic interval training group and 12 to the control group).
The aerobic interval training group performed a 12-week exercise training programme. All patients were evaluated with the Short Form-36 (SF-36), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire at baseline, after 12 weeks and at 2 years.
The aerobic interval training group showed significant improvements in several SF-36 subscores at 12 weeks. There was an unadjusted significant reduction in the HADS depression (HADS-D) score. At follow-up, results in the aero-bic interval training group moved towards baseline or remained stable, whereas in the control group HADS-D scores and some SF-36 subscores deteriorated.

26537979,Makizako et al.,Effects of exercise and horticultural intervention on the brain and mental health in older adults with depressive symptoms and memory problems: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial [UMIN000018547].,"Depressive symptoms and memory problems are significant risk factors for dementia. Exercise can reduce depressive symptoms and improve cognitive function in older people. In addition, the benefits of horticultural activity on physical and mental well-being have been demonstrated in people with dementia. Although evidence of such non-pharmacological interventions is mounting, no studies have examined whether physical exercise and horticultural activity exert a positive impact on brain and mental health (e.g., depressive symptoms) in non-demented older adults at high risk of cognitive impairment and depression. Therefore, we propose a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy and efficiency of physical exercise and horticultural activity in improving brain and mental health in community-dwelling older adults with memory problems and depressive symptoms.
The 20-week randomized controlled trial will include 90 community-dwelling adults aged 65 years or older with memory problems and depressive symptoms. Participants will be randomized to one of three experiments: exercise, horticultural activity, or educational control group, using a 1:1:1 allocation ratio. The combined exercise program and horticultural activity program will consist of 20 weekly 90-minute sessions. Participants in the exercise group will practice aerobic exercise, muscle strength training, postural balance retraining, and dual-task training. The horticultural activity program will include crop-related activities, such as field cultivation, growing, and harvesting. Participants in the educational control group will attend two 90-minute educational classes during the 6-month trial period. Depressive symptoms and memory performance will be measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale-15, and the Logical Memory subtests of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised will be used to measure depressive symptoms and memory performance as primary outcomes, at baseline (prior to randomization), immediately following intervention (6 months from baseline), and 6 months after intervention. Hippocampal volume will be measured at baseline and immediately after intervention, using magnetic resonance imaging. Secondary outcomes will comprise cognitive function, including language, attention/executive performance, and processing speed; brain-derived neurotrophic-factor serum levels; and health-related quality of life.
This intervention study will determine the clinical importance and efficacy of physical exercise and horticultural activity as non-pharmacological interventions in community-dwelling older adults at high risk of poor brain and mental health.

Clinical tests were videotaped and analysed by a second rater, blind to group allocation and assessment time.
32 participants (resistance training: n = 17, balance training: n = 15; 8 drop-outs) were analyzed at 8-weeks follow-up. No significant difference was found in the FAB scale when comparing the effects of the two training types (p = 0.14; effect size (Cohen's d) = -0.59). Participants from the resistance training group, but not from the balance training group significantly improved on the FAB scale (resistance training: +2.4 points, Cohen's d = -0.46; balance training: +0.3 points, Cohen's d = -0.08). Within the resistance training group, improvements of the FAB scale were significantly correlated with improvements of rate of force development and stride time variability. No significant differences were found in the secondary outcome measures when comparing the training effects of both training types.
The difference between resistance and balance training to improve postural control in people with Parkinson's disease was small and not significant with this sample size. There was weak evidence that freely coordinated resistance training might be more effective than balance training. Our results indicate a relationship between the enhancement of rate of force development and the improvement of postural control.

26363365,Pavsic et al.,"Short-term impact of fampridine on motor and cognitive functions, mood and quality of life among multiple sclerosis patients.","Previous studies have predominantly investigated the effect of fampridine on lower extremities motor functions while data on its impact on other symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) are scarce. The aim of our study was to assess the impact of fampridine on walking, arm/hand function, fatigue, cognitive function, mood and quality of life among responders.
Our prospective non-randomized study included 30 patients with different types of MS, aged 35-70, EDSS value 3.5-6.5. They were treated with 10mg of fampridine twice daily. The examinations were performed before the treatment, after 14 days, when responders were defined by T25FW (Timed 25-Foot Walk) and 2-min walk test (2MWT) was performed, and after 28 days of treatment, when only the responders were examined. Standardized protocols and questionnaires were used to evaluate the impact of fampridine on walking speed (T25FW, 2MWT), arm/hand function (9-HPT - Nine-Hole Peg Test), cognitive function (PASAT - Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test), total MSFC score (Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite), fatigue (MFIS - Modified Fatigue Impact Scale), mood (BDI - Beck Depression Inventory) and quality of life (EQ-5D index, EQ-VAS - Euro Quality of Life - 5 Dimension questionnaire and visual analogue scale) in responders.
Response rate was 56.7%. Average improvement of T25FW and 2MWT after 14 days of treatment in responders was 3.6s (34.5%) and 37.4m (42.3%), respectively. This improvement persisted after 28 days of treatment. In non-responders there was no significant improvement of T25FW after 14 days (p=0.689), but there was improvement of 2MWT for 13.4m (14.3%) (p=0.000). After 28 days of treatment significant improvement among responders occurred in total MSFC score (p=0.001), 9-HPT (p=0.002), BDI (p=0.005), MFIS total score (p=0.003), physical (p=0.001), cognitive (p=0.008) MFIS subscales, and EQ-5D index (p=0.012). There were implied trends towards improvement in EQ-VAS and psychosocial MFIS subscale, yet not significant (p=0.057 and p=0.127, respectively). There was no statistically significant improvement of PASAT (p=0.432).
The results of our study highlight the potential of fampridine for improving not only walking speed but also arm/hand function, physical and cognitive fatigue, mood and quality of life. There was no objective improvement of cognitive function. Further placebo-controlled studies will be needed for precise definition of fampridine's action beyond its impact on walking.","['4-Aminopyridine', 'Arm/hand function', 'Cognitive function', 'Depression', 'Fampridine', 'Mood', 'Multiple sclerosis', 'Quality of life']",Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,10.1016/j.clineuro.2015.08.023,2015-09-13,"[{'lastname': 'Pavsic', 'firstname': 'Katja', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'University of Ljubljana, Medical Faculty, Vrazov trg 2, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.

26268901,Grover et al.,Lower physical activity is associated with higher disease burden in pediatric multiple sclerosis.,"To evaluate the association between physical activity (PA) and multiple sclerosis (MS) disease activity, depression, and fatigue in a cohort of children with MS and monophasic acquired demyelinating syndrome (mono-ADS).
In this cross-sectional study of consecutive patients attending a specialized pediatric MS clinic, we administered the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale, Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, and Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire. Quantitative MRI analysis was performed to obtain whole brain and T2 lesion volume in a subset of participants (n = 60).
A total of 110 patients (79 mono-ADS; 31 MS; 5-18 years; M:F 1:1.2) were included. Patients with MS reported less strenuous (33.21 ± 31.88 metabolic equivalents [METs] vs 15.97 ± 22.73 METs, p = 0.002) and total (44.48 ± 39.35 METs vs 67.28 ± 59.65 METs; p = 0.0291) PA than those with mono-ADS. Patients with MS who reported greater amounts of moderate PA METs had fewer sleep/rest fatigue symptoms (r = -0.4). Participation in strenuous PA was associated with smaller T2 lesion volumes (r = -0.66) and lower annualized relapse rate (r = -0.66). No associations were found between total brain volume and participation in PA.
Children with MS are less physically active than children with mono-ADS. Reasons for this are unclear, but may be related to ongoing disease activity, perceived limitations, or symptoms such as depression or fatigue. Children with MS reporting higher levels of strenuous PA had lower T2 lesion volumes and lower relapse rates, suggesting a potential protective effect of strenuous PA in this population. Further longitudinal studies are needed to establish the relationship of PA to MS symptoms and disease activity in this population.",[],Neurology,10.1212/WNL.0000000000001939,2015-08-14,"[{'lastname': 'Grover', 'firstname': 'Stephanie A', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': ""From the Division of Neurology (S.A.G., E.A.Y.), Department of Pediatrics, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, and Program in Neurosciences and Mental Health, SickKids Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada;

26265421,Doose et al.,Self-selected intensity exercise in the treatment of major depression: A pragmatic RCT.,"The purpose of the study was to determine the therapeutic effect of physical exercise for patients with unipolar depression. Participants took part in an 8-week walking/running aerobic exercise program at a local sports club.
Forty-six outpatients aged 18-65 years and diagnosed with mild to severe depression (ICD-10 criteria) were randomly assigned to an intervention group or wait list. Treatment as usual was continued. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-17) served as the main outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures were Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), Fitness Index (FI), and VO(2) max as estimated by Urho Kaleka Kekkonen or UKK 2-km Walk Test.
Out of forty-six participants, 24% dropped out. Participants attended 58% of exercise sessions. All randomized participants were included in intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Analysis of covariance or ANCOVA showed a large reduction of depressive symptoms in HRSD-17 scores (Cohen's d: 1.8; mean change 8.2, p < .0001). BDI-II (Cohen's d: 0.50; mean change: 4.7, p = 0.09), FI scores (Cohen's d: 0.27; mean change: 5.3, p = 0.08), and VO2 max did not change significantly.
We observed a large and clinically significant change in HRSD-17 scores. Moderate changes in BDI-II scores without clinical significance and small changes in physical fitness assessments were observed.","['Aerobic exercise', 'depression', 'intervention vs. wait list', 'non-clinical population', 'pragmatic RCT']",International journal of psychiatry in clinical practice,10.3109/13651501.2015.1082599,2015-08-13,"[{'lastname': 'Doose', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'a Department of Psychiatry , Social Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Hannover Medical School , Germany.\nb Department of Neurology , Klinikum Emden , Emden , Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Ziegenbein', 'firstname': 'Marc', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'c KRH Psychiatrie Wunstorf und Langenhagen , Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Hoos', 'firstname': 'Olaf', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'd Sports Center, Julius-Maximilians-University , Wuerzburg , Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Reim', 'firstname': 'Dominik', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'd Sports Center, Julius-Maximilians-University , Wuerzburg , Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Stengert', 'firstname': 'Wojciech', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'a Department of Psychiatry , Social Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Hannover Medical School , Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Hoffer', 'firstname': 'Niklas', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'a Department of Psychiatry , Social Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Hannover Medical School , Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Vogel', 'firstname': 'Charlotte', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'e Institute for Biostatistics, Hannover Medical School , Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Ziert', 'firstname': 'Yvonne', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'e Institute for Biostatistics, Hannover Medical School , Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Sieberer', 'firstname': 'Marcel', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'a Department of Psychiatry , Social Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Hannover Medical School , Germany.'}]",26265421,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Int J Psychiatry Clin Pract"""

We conducted an observational cross-sectional study at Federal University of São Carlos (Brazil). We assessed 67 community-dwelling older adults aged 80 years and over, who were able to walk alone and did not present with a risk of dementia (assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE). The assessment consisted of anamnesis, dual task using the Timed Up and Go test associated with a motor task (TUGT-motor) and a cognitive task (TUGT-cognitive); cognitive measures using MMSE, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Clock Drawing test (CDT) and verbal fluency, and depressive measures by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).
There was a correlation with higher magnitude between cognitive tests and TUGT-cognitive, compared to TUGT-motor. For TUGT-motor, the highest correlations with cognitive tests were found between time and MMSE, MoCA (total score), and MoCA visuospatial/executive domain. For TUGT-cognitive, the highest correlations with cognitive tests were between number of steps and MMSE and between time and MMSE. GDS showed a significant weak correlation with number of steps taken in TUGT-motor, wrong words, and correct/time of TUGT-cognitive.
Dual task performances are associated with cognition in oldest old. Furthermore, dual task tests have less influence of educational level, are functional, fast, and easily applicable in clinical practice. Future studies are needed to confirm if dual task test is useful for cognitive screening in oldest old.","['aged 80 years and over', 'analysis of task performance', 'gait', 'mental processes']",International psychogeriatrics,10.1017/S1041610215000915,2015-07-02,"[{'lastname': 'Ansai', 'firstname': 'Juliana Hotta', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': 'Postgraduate Program of Physiotherapy,Federal University of São Carlos,São Carlos,Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Aurichio', 'firstname': 'Thais Rabiatti', 'initials': 'TR', 'affiliation': 'Postgraduate Program of Physiotherapy,Federal University of São Carlos,São Carlos,Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Rebelatto', 'firstname': 'José Rubens', 'initials': 'JR', 'affiliation': 'Postgraduate Program of Physiotherapy,Federal University of São Carlos,São Carlos,Brazil.'}]",26132488,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Int Psychogeriatr"""
26116155,"Luk, Khan, Irving",Maintaining Gains Following Pulmonary Rehabilitation.,"Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an accepted intervention for individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Despite initial improvements following PR, many patients eventually return to baseline function or decline even further. The aim of this study is to look at long-term (>1 year) outcomes following PR.
This was a prospective cohort study of patients who had completed PR. Participants were invited for an assessment consisting of participant interviews and clinical assessments using standardised instruments.
129 patients between 2003 and 2012 completed rehabilitation and were eligible. 88 patients were included in the analysis. The mean time of the long-term assessment was 22 months following PR. The mean age was 71 years. Mean FEV1 was 46%. There was a statistically significant (p < 0.001) increase in the incremental shuttle walk test distance of 29.0 m following PR but this gain was lost at the long-term reassessment. Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) scores showed a statistically significant (p < 0.001) increase in all four domains but only the domains of dyspnoea and fatigue remained statistically significant (p < 0.001, p < 0.01, respectively) at the long-term reassessment. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores reduced following rehabilitation but only the anxiety component was statistically significant (p < 0.01). These improvements persisted at the long-term reassessment but were not statically significant.
This study confirms that many of the functional gains achieved in PR are lost in the longer term. Regular surveillance or monitoring of these patients post-PR is important to identify those requiring further intervention.","['Chronic obstructive', 'Exercise', 'Pulmonary disease', 'Pulmonary rehabilitation']",Lung,10.1007/s00408-015-9751-5,2015-06-28,"[{'lastname': 'Luk', 'firstname': 'Edwin K', 'initials': 'EK', 'affiliation': 'Royal Melbourne Hospital - Royal Park Campus, 34 Poplar Road, Parkville, VIC, 3052, Australia. edwin.luk@mh.org.au.'}, {'lastname': 'Khan', 'firstname': 'Fary', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Royal Melbourne Hospital - Royal Park Campus, 34 Poplar Road, Parkville, VIC, 3052, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Irving', 'firstname': 'Louis', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Royal Melbourne Hospital, Grattan Street, Parkville, VIC, 3050, Australia.'}]","26116155

26110625,Mkacher et al.,Balance Training in Pulmonary Rehabilitation: EFFECTS ON PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES.,"Balance impairment in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with a worsening of quality of life (QOL) as related with fatigue perception, depression, and anxiety. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of balance training included in pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) on QOL, fatigue perception, depression, and anxiety in patients with COPD.
Patients were assigned randomly to an intervention or PR-only group. The intervention group underwent balance training 3 times a week for 6 months concurrently with PR. The PR-only group received 6 months of the standard PR program. Quality of life was assessed at the beginning and at the end of the program using the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, fatigue using the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, and anxiety and depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Exercise tolerance was determined from the 6-minute walk test.
After the 6 months of the intervention or PR-only, both the intervention (n = 32) and PR-only (n = 30) groups improved their QOL (activity, impact, and total) with a significant intergroup difference (P < .05) after PR. General fatigue, physical fatigue, and reduced activity decreased in both groups with an intergroup difference (P < .05). Anxiety decreased significantly in both groups with a greater change in the intervention group (P < .01). Only the intervention group had an improved depression score at the end of 6 months.

26105535,Huang et al.,Physical fitness exercise versus cognitive behavior therapy on reducing the depressive symptoms among community-dwelling elderly adults: A randomized controlled trial.,"Depression is a major health problem for community-dwelling elderly adults. Since limited resources are available to decrease the high prevalence of depressive symptoms among the elderly adults, improved support for them can be provided if we can determine which intervention is superior in ridding depressive symptoms.
To compare the effectiveness of the physical fitness exercise program and the cognitive behavior therapy program on primary (depressive symptoms) and secondary outcomes (6-min walk distance, quality of life, and social support) for community-dwelling elderly adults with depressive symptoms.
A prospective randomized control trial was conducted in three communities in northern Taiwan.
The elderly adults in the three communities were invited to participate by mail, phone calls, and posters. There were a total of 57 participants who had depressive symptoms and all without impaired cognition that participated in this trial. None of the participants withdrew during the 9 months of follow-up for this study.
Fifty-seven participants were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: the physical fitness exercise program group, the cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) group, or the control group. The primary (Geriatric Depression Scale-15, GDS-15), and secondary outcomes (6-min walk distance, SF-36, and Inventory of Socially Supportive Behaviors scales, ISSB) were collected immediately (T2), at 3 months (T3), and at 6 months after the interventions (T4).
After the interventions, the CBT group participants demonstrated significantly lower symptoms of depression (p=0.009) at T2 and perceived more social support from those around them (p<0.001, <0.001 and =0.004, respectively) at three time-point comparisons than the control group. Moreover, after intervention, participants in the physical fitness exercise program group had decreased GDS-15 scores at three time-point comparisons (p=0.003, 0.012 and 0.037, respectively), had a substantially greater 6-min walk distance (p=0.023), a better quality of life (p<0.001), and a better perceived social support at T2 (p<0.001).
Immediately after a 12-week intervention, there were significant decreases in depressive symptoms and more perceived social support amongst those in the CBT group. When considering the effectiveness in the decrease of depressive symptoms longer term, the increase in the 6-min walk distance and raising the patients' quality of life, physical fitness exercise program may be a better intervention for elderly adults with depressive symptoms.","['Cognitive behavior therapy', 'Depression', 'Elderly adults', 'Physical fitness']",International journal of nursing studies,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2015.05.013,2015-06-25,"[{'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Tzu-Ting', 'initials': 'TT', 'affiliation': 'School of Nursing, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taiwan; Healthy Aging Research Center, Chang Gung University, Taiwan.

26061865,Culph et al.,Men's Sheds and the experience of depression in older Australian men.,"Men's Sheds are community spaces where, usually, older men can socialise as they participate in a range of woodwork and other activities. There is currently little research evidence supporting the anecdotally reported mental health and wellbeing benefits of Men's Sheds. This research project investigated how older men with self-reported symptoms of depression experience their participation in Men's Sheds.
This study included in-depth interviews and administration of the Beck Depression Inventory-II with 12 men from 3 Men's Sheds, triangulated with observation of the different shed environments. Interviews explored how participation in the Men's Shed, living in a regional area, and retirement intersected with experiences of depression. Participants had either self-reported symptoms of depression or a diagnosis of depression.
The findings from this study support the notion that participation at Men's Sheds decreases self-reported symptoms of depression. Beck Depression Inventory-II scores showed that most participants were currently experiencing minimal depression. The Men's Sheds environment promoted a sense of purpose through relationships and in the sharing of skills, new routines, motivation, and enjoyment for its members. The shed encouraged increased physical activity and use of cognitive skills. Finally, participants reported feelings of pride and achievement which had an impact on their sense of self-worth.
Men's Sheds provide an opportunity to promote health and wellbeing among retired men. The shed's activity and social focus offers a way to help men rediscover purpose and self. Further research is required to measure symptoms of depression before and after participation in Men's Sheds.","['depression', 'masculinity', ""men's health"", ""men's shed"", 'mentoring', 'regional and remote', 'research']",Australian occupational therapy journal,10.1111/1440-1630.12190,2015-06-11,"[{'lastname': 'Culph', 'firstname': 'Jennifer S', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Health Science, University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Wilson', 'firstname': 'Nathan J', 'initials': 'NJ', 'affiliation': 'School of Nursing and Midwifery, University of Western Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Cordier', 'firstname': 'Reinie', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'School of Occupational Therapy and Social Work, Curtin University, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Stancliffe', 'firstname': 'Roger J', 'initials': 'RJ', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Health Science, University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.'}]",26061865,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Aust Occup Ther J"""
26037604,Yoshida et al.,Longitudinal association between habitual physical activity and depressive symptoms in older people.,"Prevention of depressive symptoms is an essential issue with regard to the promotion of healthy lifestyles in older people. To date, few studies have examined the relation between fluctuations in physical activity and depression among older individuals. We thus conducted a longitudinal survey of older adults to examine the effect of long-term fluctuating physical activity on the incidence of depressive symptoms.
A 3-year prospective cohort study was performed in a community-based environment. A total of 680 individuals (291 men and 389 women) aged 65 years and over at the baseline assessment participated. The 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale was used to assess depressive symptoms, with scores of ≥6 indicative of depression. Participants were categorized into the following four groups based on change in physical activity status between 2002 and 2003: sedentary, cessation, initiation, and maintenance.
The incidence of depressive symptoms was 16.9% (16.8% in men and 17.0% in women) at the 3-year follow up (in 2006). Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that physical activity maintenance (odds ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.30-0.83) only reduced the incidence of depressive symptoms at the 3-year follow up after adjusting for confounding variables.
Continuous physical activity may be a valuable and simple way to prevent depressive symptoms in community-dwelling older people. Therefore, it is necessary to implement interventions that teach older adults how to integrate physical activity into their daily lives.","['community-dwelling older adults', 'depression symptoms', 'longitudinal study', 'physical activity']",Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences,10.1111/pcn.12324,2015-06-04,"[{'lastname': 'Yoshida', 'firstname': 'Yuko', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Iwasa', 'firstname': 'Hajime', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology, Tokyo, Japan.\nDepartment of Public Health, Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine, Fukushima, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kumagai', 'firstname': 'Shu', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'University of Human Arts and Sciences, Saitama, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Suzuki', 'firstname': 'Takao', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Aichi, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Awata', 'firstname': 'Shuichi', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yoshida', 'firstname': 'Hideyo', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology, Tokyo, Japan.'}]",26037604,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,DENIED: Wiley E Publisher says no to https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pcn.12324/pdf
25998702,Haslacher et al.,Physical exercise counteracts genetic susceptibility to depression.,"Depression is a highly prevalent disorder in elderly individuals. A genetic variant (rs6265) of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) impacting on emotion processing is known to increase the risk for depression. We aim to investigate whether intensive endurance sports might attenuate this genetic susceptibility in a cohort of elderly marathon athletes.
Fifty-five athletes and 58 controls were included. rs6265 of the BDNF gene was genotyped by the TaqMan method. Depressive symptoms were assessed by standardized self-rating tests (BDI = Beck Depression Inventory, GDS = Geriatric Depression Scale).
In multivariable analysis of BDI and GDS scores, the interaction between group (athletes vs. controls) and genotypes ([C];[C] vs. [C];[T] + [T];[T]) was found to be statistically significant (BDI: p = 0.027, GDS: p = 0.013). Among [C];[C] carriers, merely controls had an increased relative risk of 3.537 (95% CI = 1.276-9.802) of achieving a subclinical depression score ≥10 on the BDI. There was no such effect in carriers of the [T] allele. In a multivariable binary logistic regression, genetic information, group (athletes/controls), but no information on rs6265 allele carrier status presented as a significant predictor of BDI scores ≥10.
Physical exercise positively affects BDNF effects on mood. Since 66Met BDNF secretion is impaired, this effect seems to be much stronger in [C];[C] homozygous individuals expressing the 66Val variant. This confirms that genetic susceptibility to depressive symptoms can indeed be influenced by endurance sports in elderly people.",[],Neuropsychobiology,10.1159/000381350,2015-05-23,"[{'lastname': 'Haslacher', 'firstname': 'Helmuth', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Michlmayr', 'firstname': 'Matthias', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Batmyagmar', 'firstname': 'Delgerdalai', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Perkmann', 'firstname': 'Thomas', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ponocny-Seliger', 'firstname': 'Elisabeth', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Scheichenberger', 'firstname': 'Vanessa', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Pilger', 'firstname': 'Alexander', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Dal-Bianco', 'firstname': 'Peter', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lehrner', 'firstname': 'Johann', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Pezawas', 'firstname': 'Lukas', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wagner', 'firstname': 'Oswald', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Winker', 'firstname': 'Robert', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}]",25998702,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,TXERROR: 403 status returned from Karger url (http://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/381350)
25856203,"Durcan, Flavin, Horgan",Factors associated with community ambulation in chronic stroke.,"Loss of independent community ambulation is one of the most disabling consequences of stroke. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of multiple personal and post-stroke factors with community ambulation in persons between 1- and 3-year post-stroke.
This was a cross-sectional study of 40 community-dwelling stroke patients, >18 years, between 1- and 3-year post-stroke. The main outcome measures used were self-report community ambulation questionnaire, demographic information, 10-M Walk Test, Timed Up and Go test, Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale, Fatigue Severity Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Trail-Making Test-Part B, Single Letter Cancellation Test.
Age, number of medications and use of a walking aid were found to be significantly associated with community ambulation (p ≤ 0.05). Gait speed, walking balance and balance self-efficacy were also found to be significantly associated with community ambulation (p ≤ 0.05). Balance self-efficacy was the only factor independently associated with community ambulation post-stroke (p ≤ 0.05).
Balance self-efficacy may be a significant determinant in the attainment of independent community ambulation post-stroke. This suggests that physical aspects such as gait speed and walking balance should not be considered in isolation when addressing community ambulation post-stroke.
Balance self-efficacy may play a significant role in the attainment of independent community ambulation in a chronic stroke population. Physiotherapy interventions addressing community ambulation post-stroke should consider methods for improving balance self-efficacy in chronic stroke, such as self management programmes.","['Balance self-efficacy', 'community ambulation', 'gait', 'stroke']",Disability and rehabilitation,10.3109/09638288.2015.1035460,2015-04-10,"[{'lastname': 'Durcan', 'firstname': 'Sarah', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'a Stroke Rehabilitation Team, Baggot Street Community Hospital , Dublin , Ireland and.'}, {'lastname': 'Flavin', 'firstname': 'Evelyn', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'a Stroke Rehabilitation Team, Baggot Street Community Hospital , Dublin , Ireland and.'}, {'lastname': 'Horgan', 'firstname': 'Frances', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'b School of Physiotherapy, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland , Dublin , Ireland.'}]",25856203,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Disabil Rehabil"""
25775108,Chen et al.,"Neighborhood support network, perceived proximity to community facilities and depressive symptoms among low socioeconomic status Chinese elders.","Depressive symptoms are common in older people; most previous research on elderly depression focused on individual-level characteristics or neighborhood socioeconomic status. Modifiable neighborhood characteristics of older people dwelling in low-income communities are under-studied. This study aims to identify potentially modifiable social and physical neighborhood characteristics that influence depressive symptoms independent of individual-level characteristics among older Chinese.
Data came from a cross-sectional survey conducted in four low-income public rental housing estates in Hong Kong in 2012. We interviewed a total of 400 elderly residents. The structured questionnaire covered demographics, activities of daily living, recent fall history, neighborhood support networks, and perceived proximity by walk to community facilities. Multiple regression was used to test whether inclusion of neighborhood factors in addition to individual characteristics increases model fit in explaining depressive symptoms in elders with low socioeconomic status.
At individual level, activities of daily living and income significantly predicted depressive symptoms. Receiving support from friends or neighbors is associated with fewer depressive symptoms. However, participants who received organizational support had a 1.17 points of increase on the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15). At-ease walkable proximity to medical facilities was positively associated with a better GDS score.
Neighborhood support networks and perceived proximity by walk to community facilities contribute significantly to depressive symptoms among low-income elders. Programs and policies that facilitate neighborhood support and commuting or promote facility accessibility may help ameliorate depressive symptoms common among low-income elders.","['depressive symptoms', 'low-SES elders', 'neighborhood', 'perceived walkability', 'support networks']",Aging & mental health,10.1080/13607863.2015.1018867,2015-03-17,"[{'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Yan-Yan', 'initials': 'YY', 'affiliation': 'a Department of Social Work , Fudan University , Shanghai , China.\nb Sau Po Center on Ageing , The University of Hong Kong , Hong Kong , China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wong', 'firstname': 'Gloria H Y', 'initials': 'GH', 'affiliation': 'b Sau Po Center on Ageing , The University of Hong Kong , Hong Kong , China.'}, {'lastname': 'Lum', 'firstname': 'Terry Y', 'initials': 'TY', 'affiliation': 'b Sau Po Center on Ageing , The University of Hong Kong , Hong Kong , China.\nc Department of Social Work and Social Administration, Sau Po Center on Ageing , The University of Hong Kong , Hong Kong , China.'}, {'lastname': 'Lou', 'firstname': 'Vivian W Q', 'initials': 'VW', 'affiliation': 'c Department of Social Work and Social Administration, Sau Po Center on Ageing , The University of Hong Kong , Hong Kong , China.'}, {'lastname': 'Ho', 'firstname': 'Andy H Y', 'initials': 'AH', 'affiliation': 'd Division of Psychology, School of Humanities and Social Sciences , Nanyang Technological University , Singapore.'}, {'lastname': 'Luo', 'firstname': 'Hao', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'b Sau Po Center on Ageing , The University of Hong Kong , Hong Kong , China.'}, {'lastname': 'Tong', 'firstname': 'Tracy L W', 'initials': 'TL', 'affiliation': 'b Sau Po Center on Ageing , The University of Hong Kong , Hong Kong , China.'}]",25775108,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Aging Ment Health"""

25554666,Bhamani et al.,"Depression and its association with functional status and physical activity in the elderly in Karachi, Pakistan.","The aim of the study was to determine the functional status and level of physical activity and their association with depression in the elderly population (age 60 and above) in Karachi, Pakistan.
This was a cross-sectional study. Subjects were recruited through multi-stage cluster sampling technique. Questionnaire-based interviews were conducted from July to September 2008. Functional status and physical activity were assessed using activities of daily living (ADL) and physical activity questionnaires, respectively. Depression was evaluated using the 15-item geriatric depression scale (GDS).
Both mean ADL score (9.9±0.2 vs. 9.6±0.2) as well as time spent in physical activity/week (377.3±26.9min vs. 251.7±15.4min) was higher in men than women, respectively. Subjects spending more than 310min (>5.2h) per week in physical activity were 60% less likely to be depressed compared to those who spent less than 120min (<2h) per week (Adjusted OR=0.4, 95% CI=0.2-0.7). A one unit increase in ADL score showed a 10% decrease in depression after adjusting for other variables (Adjusted OR=0.9, 95% CI=0.8-0.9).
We found a strong association between depression and time spent in physical activities as well as activities of daily living. Our results indicate the potentially important positive role of higher functional status and physical activity in prevention of depression in the elderly in Karachi.","['Assessment of depression and physical activity in elderly Cross-sectional study in Karachi—Pakistan', 'Depression', 'Elderly', 'Functional status', 'Karachi', 'Pakistan', 'Physical activity']",Asian journal of psychiatry,10.1016/j.ajp.2014.12.004,2015-01-03,"[{'lastname': 'Bhamani', 'firstname': 'Mehreen Anwar', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Community Health Sciences, Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan.

27357556,Shachar-Malach et al.,Effectiveness of Aerobic Exercise as an Augmentation Therapy for Inpatients with Major Depressive Disorder: A Preliminary Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Physical exercise has been shown to reduce depressive symptoms when used in combination with antidepressant medication. We report a randomized controlled trial of aerobic exercise compared to stretching as an augmentation strategy for hospitalized patients with major depression.
Male or female patients, 18-80 years, diagnosed with a Major Depressive Episode, were randomly assigned to three weeks of augmentation therapy with aerobic (n=6) or stretching exercise (n=6). Depression was rated, at several time points using the 21-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and other scales.
According to the HAM-D, there were four (out of six) responders in the aerobic group, two of whom achieved remission, and none in the stretching group. According to the BDI, there were two responders in the aerobic group who were also remitters and none in the stretching group.
The results of this small study suggest that aerobic exercise significantly improves treatment outcome when added to antidepressant medication.

We recruited 116 patients from a medical centre in northern Taiwan, and randomly assigned them to either a walking-exercise group (n=58) or a usual-care group (n=58). We conducted a 12-week exercise programme that comprised home-based, moderate-intensity walking for 40 min per day, 3 days per week, and weekly exercise counselling. The outcome measures included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Taiwanese version of the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory.
We analysed the effects of the exercise programme on anxiety, depression and cancer-related symptoms by using a generalised estimating equation method. The exercise group patients exhibited significant improvements in their anxiety levels over time (P=0.009 and 0.006 in the third and sixth months, respectively) and depression (P=0.00006 and 0.004 in the third and sixth months, respectively) than did the usual-care group patients.

A total of 69 sedentary older adults aged older than 80 years were assessed and randomized into three groups (control, multicomponent and resistance training). The multicomponent group performed protocol consisting of aerobic, strength and balance exercises. The resistance group participated in strength exercises using six machines. The control group did not perform any intervention. The training sessions had progressive intensity, lasted 16 weeks and included three sessions per week. The volunteers were assessed at baseline, at the end of the 16-week training sessions and after the 6-week detraining period. The assessment consisted of anamneses, Geriatric Depression Scale and cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Clock Drawing Test, verbal fluency and dual task).
There were no significant differences between groups and times in any of variables; however, the adherence to training was low, mainly in the multicomponent group.

25133492,Bernard et al.,Effects of a six-month walking intervention on depression in inactive post-menopausal women: a randomized controlled trial.,"Physical inactivity and advanced age are associated with risk of depressive disorders. Physical activity can reduce depressive symptoms in older subjects with depressive disorders. We investigated whether a walking intervention program may decrease the occurrence of depressive symptoms in inactive post-menopausal women without depression.
A total of 121 participants aged 57-75 years were randomly assigned to a six-month moderate intensity walking intervention (three times a week, 40 minutes per session, supervised and home-based) or to a control group (waiting list). Inactivity was assessed using the Physical Activity Questionnaire for the Elderly. Depression levels were measured pre- and post-intervention with the Beck depression inventory (BDI). Several baseline measures were considered as possible predictors of post-intervention BDI score.
Participants in the walking intervention showed a significant decrease in depression as compared with controls. Baseline cognitive-BDI subscore, subjective health status, body mass index and adherence were post-intervention BDI score predictors.
A six-month, three-session per week, moderate intensity walking intervention with a minimal 50% adherence rate reduces depression in post-menopausal women at risk for depression due to physical inactivity. This type of walking intervention could be considered as a widely accessible prevention strategy to prevent depressive symptoms in post-menopausal women at risk of depression.","['depressive disorders', 'exercise', 'physical activity', 'post-menopausal women', 'predictors', 'walking']",Aging & mental health,10.1080/13607863.2014.948806,2014-08-19,"[{'lastname': 'Bernard', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'a Laboratory EA4556 Epsylon , Montpellier 1 University , Montpellier , France.'}, {'lastname': 'Ninot', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bernard', 'firstname': 'P L', 'initials': 'PL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Picot', 'firstname': 'M C', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Jaussent', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tallon', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Blain', 'firstname': 'H', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}]",25133492,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Aging Ment Health"""

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and predictors of anxiety and depression in people with ILD.
One hundred and twenty-four individuals with ILD (age 64 years (standard deviation 12), 48 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) participated. Anxiety and depression were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale to determine likely cases and borderline cases. Associations with demographic data, respiratory function, 6-min walk and Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale (MMRC) were examined.
The prevalence of anxiety was 31%, with clinically significant anxiety in 12%. Depression was present in 23% of individuals, with 7% having clinically significant depression. Independent predictors of anxiety were a higher MMRC score (P = 0.005, odds ratio (OR) for case 2.60, 95% confidence interval 1.37 to 4.92) and higher nadir SpO2 during walking (P = 0.003, OR for case 1.16, 1.04-1.30). Independent predictors of depression were a higher MMRC score (P = 0.006, case OR 3.84, 1.25-11.78, borderline case OR 2.44, 1.14-5.19) and a greater number of comorbidities (P = 0.003, case OR 2.02, 0.97-4.21, borderline case OR 2.26, 1.30-3.93).
Anxiety and depression are present in a significant minority of individuals with ILD.

25065540,Morano et al.,Comparison of the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation with chest physical therapy on the levels of fibrinogen and albumin in patients with lung cancer awaiting lung resection: a randomized clinical trial.,"Systemic inflammation plays an important role in the initiation, promotion, and progression of lung carcinogenesis. In patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), fibrinogen levels correlate with neoplasia. Here we compared the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) with chest physical therapy (CPT) on fibrinogen and albumin levels in patients with LC and previous inflammatory lung disease awaiting lung resection.
We conducted a randomized clinical trial with 24 patients who were randomly assigned to Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR) and Chest Physical Therapy (CPT) groups. Each group underwent training 5 days weekly for 4 weeks. All patients were assessed before and after four weeks of training through clinical assessment, measurement of fibrinogen and albumin levels, spirometry, 6-minute Walk Test (6MWT), quality of life survey, and anxiety and depression scale. PR involved strength and endurance training, and CPT involved lung expansion techniques. Both groups attended educational classes.
A mixed between-within subjects analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a significant interaction between time (before and after intervention) and group (PR vs. CPT) on fibrinogen levels (F(1, 22)=0.57, p<0.0001) and a significant main effect of time (F(1, 22)=0.68, p=0.004). Changes in albumin levels were not statistically significant relative to the interaction effect between time and group (F(1, 22)=0.96, p=0.37) nor the main effects of time (F(1, 22)=1.00, p=1.00) and group (F(1, 22 )=0.59, p=0.45). A mixed between-within subjects ANOVA revealed significant interaction effects between time and group for the peak work rate of the unsupported upper limb exercise (F(1, 22)=0.77, p=0.02), endurance time (F(1, 22)=0.60, p=0.001), levels of anxiety (F(1, 22)=0.60, p=0.002) and depression (F(1, 22)=0.74, p=0.02), and the SF-36 physical component summary (F(1, 22)=0.83, p=0.07).
PR reduced serum fibrinogen levels, improved functional parameters, and quality of life of patients with LC and inflammatory lung disease awaiting lung resection.

24884440,"Siddiqui, Lindblad, Bennet",Physical inactivity is strongly associated with anxiety and depression in Iraqi immigrants to Sweden: a cross-sectional study.,"Increasing evidence on associations between mental health and chronic diseases like cardio-vascular disease and diabetes together with the fact that little is known about the prevalence of anxiety/depression and associated risk factors among Iraqi immigrants to Sweden, warrants a study in this group. The aim was to study the prevalence of anxiety and depression in immigrants from Iraq compared to native Swedes and compare socioeconomic and lifestyle-related factors associated with these conditions.
A population-based, cross-sectional study of residents of Malmö, Sweden, aged 30-75 years, born in Iraq or Sweden. The overall response rate was 49% for Iraqis and 32% for Swedes. Anxiety and depression were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Associations were studied using multivariate logistic regression models. The outcome was odds of depression and/or anxiety.
Compared to Swedes (n = 634), anxiety was three times as prevalent (52.6 vs. 16.3%, p < 0.001) and depression five times as prevalent (16.3 vs. 3.1%, p < 0.001) in Iraqi immigrants (n = 1255). Iraqis were three times more likely to be anxious and/or depressed compared to Swedes (odds ratio (OR) 3.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.06-4.41). Among Iraqis, physical inactivity (<150 min/week) (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.49-2.69), economic insecurity (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.56-3.01), inability to trust people (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.28-2.39) and smoking (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.02-2.01), were strongly associated with anxiety/depression. Among Swedes, living alone (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.36-3.25) and economic insecurity (OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.38-4.12) showed the strongest associations with anxiety/depression. Country of birth modified the effect of physical inactivity (P(interaction) =0.058) as well as of marital status (P(interaction) =0.001).
Our study indicates that economic insecurity has a major impact on poor mental health irrespective of ethnic background but that physical inactivity may be more strongly associated with anxiety/depression in immigrants from the Middle East compared to native Swedes. Preventive actions emphasizing increased physical activity may reduce the risk of poor mental health in immigrants from the Middle East, however intervention studies are warranted to test this hypothesis.",[],BMC public health,"10.1186/1471-2458-14-502

24867906,"Durmus, Unal, Kuru",How effective is a modified exercise program on its own or with back school in chronic low back pain? A randomized-controlled clinical trial.,"The aim of this trial is to search effectiveness of specifically adapted exercise programs on its own and with low back school on pain, disability, trunk and quadriceps muscle strength, walking performance, spinal mobility, quality of life (QOL), and depression in the patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP).
A total of 121 patients with definite CLBP were included in this study. The patients were randomized into two groups. Group 1 (n=60) was given exercises only and accepted as the control group. Group 2 (n=61) received back school program and exercises. The exercise treatment was performed 3 days a week, for 3 months. The pain (visual analog scale, VAS), disability (Oswestry Disability Questionnaire, ODQ), walking performance (6 minute walking test, 6MWT), depression (Beck Depression Inventory scores, BDI), and QOL (Short Form 36, SF-36) of all participants were evaluated. The trunk and knee muscle strength were measured with a handheld dynamometer. Patients were assessed at baseline (BT), at the end of treatment (AT), and at the six month follow-up (F).
Statistically significant improvements were found between groups regarding all of the clinical parameters over time. Pain, disability, muscle strength, endurance, 6MWT, mobility, QOL, and depression of both groups also showed improvements AT. These improvements persisted at 6-months follow-ups (P < 0.05). There were statistically significant differences between the groups for pain, disability, muscle strength, endurance, 6MWT, QOL, and depression regarding the change scores between AT-BT test and F-BT test (P < 0.05). Group 2 improved more than group 1 except for mobility.
Exercise programs can be modified and used successfully in CLBP and this effect can be increased with addition of back school further.

24731917,Saxton et al.,"Effects of an exercise and hypocaloric healthy eating intervention on indices of psychological health status, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis regulation and immune function after early-stage breast cancer: a randomised controlled trial.","Many women experience emotional distress, depression and anxiety after a diagnosis of breast cancer. Psychological stress and depression have been associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation that may adversely affect immune system functioning and impact upon survival. This study investigated the effects of a lifestyle intervention on indices of psychological health status, HPA axis regulation and immune function in overweight women recovering from early-stage breast cancer treatment.
A total of 85 women treated for breast cancer 3 to 18 months previously were randomly allocated to a 6-month exercise and hypocaloric healthy eating program plus usual care or usual care alone (control group). Women in the intervention group received three supervised exercise sessions per week and individualized dietary advice, supplemented by weekly nutrition seminars. Depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory version II: BDI-II), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale: PSS), salivary diurnal cortisol rhythms; inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and Tumor necrosis factor-α), leukocyte phenotype counts, natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity and lymphocyte proliferation following mitogenic stimulation were assessed at baseline and 6-month follow up.
Compared with the control group, the intervention group exhibited a reduction in depressive symptoms (adjusted mean difference, 95% confidence intervals (95% CI): -3.12, -1.03 to -5.26; P = 0.004) at the 6-month follow-up but no significant decrease in PSS scores (-2.07, -4.96 to 0.82; P = 0.16). The lifestyle intervention also had a significant impact on diurnal salivary cortisol rhythm compared with usual care alone, as evidenced by an increase in morning salivary cortisol at the 6-month follow-up (P <0.04), indicating a change in HPA axis regulation. Women in the control group had higher total leukocyte, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts in comparison to the intervention group at the 6-month follow-up (P ≤0.05), whereas there was no difference in NK cell counts (P = 0.46), NK cell cytotoxicity (P = 0.85) or lymphocyte proliferation responses (P = 0.11) between the two groups.
Our results show that the lifestyle intervention resulted in a reduction in depressive symptoms and a normalisation of HPA axis regulation. Such changes could have important implications for long-term survival in women recovering from early-breast cancer treatment.

Elders (N=38) enrolled in a 2-year sensor technology study in senior housing completed regular assessments of functional limitations and depressive symptoms with the Short Physical Performance Battery and Geriatric Depression Scale, respectively. Evaluation of reported PA using the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly coincided with 12-month functional limitation testing. Subjects were 69% female with mean age of 85 years. Individuals reporting greater PA had significantly fewer functional limitations at 12 months. In multiple regression analysis, baseline functional limitations explained 66% of the variance in 12-month functional limitations, while current PA explained an additional 5%. Although PA explained a small amount of variance in 12-month functional limitations, as a modifiable behavior, PA should be championed and supported to help ameliorate functional limitations in older adults.","['exercise', 'older adults', 'physical activity', 'physical function', 'retirement community']",Clinical nursing research,"10.1177/1054773813508133

This study investigated the impact of psychosocial status on balance among 23 Latino seniors after a twice-a-week, 12-week TC exercise program. Functional status was measured at baseline, immediately after, and three months following the TC exercise program, using the Timed Up and Go Test and Tinetti Falls Efficacy Scale. Psychosocial status was measured at baseline by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and Norbeck Social Support Questionnaire. Both measures of functional status improved and were sustained after three months of TC. Greater improvement was significantly related to a higher level of baseline social support. More depressed seniors reported less fear of falling after TC.

24402914,Mosleh et al.,Effects of community based cardiac rehabilitation: Comparison with a hospital-based programme.,"With typically fewer than 35% of eligible patients attending outpatient cardiac rehabilitation (CR), more accessible provision is required. Community-based cardiac rehabilitation is one option but its effects need to be compared with those of hospital-based CR.
The purpose of this study was to compare changes in health-related quality of life (HRQOL), anxiety and depression, and exercise and smoking rates, between attendees at community-based and hospital-based CR programmes.
A prospective comparative cohort design was used. Consecutive patients admitted to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and eligible for CR were recruited and followed up by self-report questionnaire. Outcomes were health status (RAND-36), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Godin Leisure-Time Exercise and smoking status.
There were 136 of 179 (75%) attenders at community-based CR, compared to 169 of 209 (80%) at hospital-based CR (p=0.242). In univariate analysis, there were no significant differences between the two groups in health status, HADS, and frequency or intensity of exercise immediately after the CR programme or six months later. Adjusting for other significant factors, patients who attended community CR reported higher RAND-36 energy scores at six months compared with attenders at hospital CR (p=0.020), but were less likely to undertake frequent exercise (p=0.041).
Community-based CR appears to achieve similar attendance rates and effects on health status and health behaviour as hospital-based CR. This option might help overcome the poor attendance of patients with long travelling times to hospital-based CR.","['Community-based cardiac rehabilitation', 'health behaviour', 'health status', 'hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation']",European journal of cardiovascular nursing,10.1177/1474515113519362,2014-01-10,"[{'lastname': 'Mosleh', 'firstname': 'Sultan M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Fundamentals and Adult Nursing, University of Mutah, Jordan s.mosleh@mutah.edu.jo.'}, {'lastname': 'Bond', 'firstname': 'Christine M', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': 'Centre of Academic Primary Care, University of Aberdeen, Scotland.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Amanda J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': 'Centre of Academic Primary Care, University of Aberdeen, Scotland.'}, {'lastname': 'Kiger', 'firstname': 'Alice', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Medical Statistics Team, University of Aberdeen, Scotland.'}, {'lastname': 'Campbell', 'firstname': 'Neil C', 'initials': 'NC', 'affiliation': 'Medical Statistics Team, University of Aberdeen, Scotland.'}]",24402914,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Eur J Cardiovasc Nurs"""

Population-based cohort study started with an examination of 809 men at age 55, followed by the first (age 68ys) and second follow up (age 82ys). 128 survivors were examined at age 82 with 99mTc-HMPAO-SPECT to estimate CBF, Zung-Self-Rating-Depression Scale (ZSDS), and Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI). Analysis was performed on men free from stroke and dementia which defined the final study population to 120 subjects.
ZSDS in the whole cohort ranged from 0.26 to 0.71 (reference 0.25-1.0). As the frequency of depressive symptoms was low, the case group (n = 31) was defined by ZSDS index above 75th percentile (≥0.48), comprising 9 subjects with mild depression (ZSDS 0.55-0.71) and 22 subjects at 88th percentile and above of the normal range (ZSDS index 0.48-0.54). Cases were more often current smokers at age 68 (44% vs. 24%; p = .02) and had lower systolic blood presure (SBP), lower social and physical activity, and suffered from fatigue, nausea, freezing and leg edema at age 82. Within the case group, ZSDS-index correlated negatively with CBF in subcortical area (r = -.42*), left and right thalamus (r = -.40*, r = -.46**), and right basal nuclei (r = -.35*). ZSDS-index correlated also with ABI at age 82 (right leg r = -.40*; left leg r = -.37*), and with Δ between ABI at age 82 and 68 (right r = -.36*; left r = -.46**). Despite decreasing SBP from age 68 to 82, adjusted multiple regression analysis showed in the case group that higher SBP determined CBF changes in the frontal and parietal areas, independently of ZSDS index, Δ ABI, and smoking.
In this population-based cohort of octogenarian men free from stroke or dementia, a proportion of subjects with depressive symptoms was low. Still, men with borderline or mild depression scores had lower social and physical activity, persistent smoking habit, worse peripheral circulation in legs, and cerebral perfusion changes in basal nuclei, thalamus and subcortical white matter. Regional CBF decline could be partly mediated by higher SBP.",[],BMC psychiatry,"10.1186/1471-244X-13-347

24279599,Julien et al.,Longitudinal associations between walking frequency and depressive symptoms in older adults: results from the VoisiNuAge study.,"Cross-sectional studies show that walking is associated with depression among older adults, but longitudinal associations have rarely been examined. The aim of this study was to investigate longitudinal associations between walking frequency and depressive symptoms in older adults to determine which variable is the stronger prospective predictor of the other.
Longitudinal; four repeated measures over 5 years.
Population-based sample of urban-dwelling older adults living in the Montreal metropolitan area.
Participants from the VoisiNuAge study aged 68 to 84 (N=498).
depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale) and number of walking days in previous week (Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly). Covariates: age, education, and number of chronic illnesses. Cross-lagged panel analyses were performed in the entire sample and in sex-stratified subsamples.
Depressive symptoms predicted walking frequency at subsequent time points (and more precisely, higher depressive symptoms were related to fewer walking days), but walking frequency did not predict depressive symptoms at subsequent time points. Stratified analyses revealed that prospective associations were statistically significant in women but not men.
The longitudinal association between walking frequency and depressive symptoms is one in which depressive symptoms predict reduced walking frequency later. Higher depressive symptoms are more likely a cause of reduced walking because of time precedence than vice versa. Future research on longitudinal relationships between meeting physical activity recommendations and depression are warranted.","['aged', 'depression', 'longitudinal studies', 'motor activity', 'walking']",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,10.1111/jgs.12546,2013-11-28,"[{'lastname': 'Julien', 'firstname': 'Dominic', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""Institut de Recherche en Santé Publique de l'Université de Montréal, Université de Montréal, Montréal, Québec, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Gauvin', 'firstname': 'Lise', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': ""Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, Université de Montréal, Montréal, Québec, Canada.\nDépartement de Médecine Sociale et Préventive, Université de Montréal, Montréal, Québec, Canada.\nCentre de Recherche Léa-Roback sur les Inégalités Sociales de Santé de Montréal, Université de Montréal, Montréal, Québec, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Richard', 'firstname': 'Lucie', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': ""Institut de Recherche en Santé Publique de l'Université de Montréal, Université de Montréal, Montréal, Québec, Canada.\nCentre de Recherche Léa-Roback sur les Inégalités Sociales de Santé de Montréal, Université de Montréal, Montréal, Québec, Canada.\nFaculté des Sciences Infirmières, Université de Montréal, Montréal, Québec, Canada.\nCentre de Recherche de l'Institut Universitaire de Gériatrie de Montréal, Université de Montréal, Montréal, Québec, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Kestens', 'firstname': 'Yan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, Université de Montréal, Montréal, Québec, Canada.\nDépartement de Médecine Sociale et Préventive, Université de Montréal, Montréal, Québec, Canada.\nCentre de Recherche Léa-Roback sur les Inégalités Sociales de Santé de Montréal, Université de Montréal, Montréal, Québec, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Payette', 'firstname': 'Hélène', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Centre de Recherche sur le Vieillissement, Centre de Santé et des Services Sociaux, Institut Universitaire de Gériatrie de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, Québec, Canada.\nDépartement des Sciences de la Santé Communautaire, Faculté de Médecine et des Sciences de la Santé, Université de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, Québec, Canada.'}]",24279599,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,DENIED: Wiley E Publisher says no to https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.12546/pdf
24103566,Almeida et al.,A risk table to assist health practitioners assess and prevent the onset of depression in later life.,"This study aimed to develop a simple risk table of modifiable factors prospectively associated with depression in later life that could be used to guide the assessment, management and introduction of preventive strategies in clinical practice.
This retrospective cohort study included 4636 men aged 65 to 83 years living in the community who denied history of past diagnosis or treatment for depression. They self-reported information about their physical activity, weight and height, smoking history, alcohol consumption and dietary habits, as well as history of hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease and stroke. We calculated the body mass index (BMI) in kg/m(2). Three to 8 years later they were assessed with the Geriatric Depression Scale 15 (GDS-15) and those with a total score of 7 or greater were considered to display clinically significant symptoms of depression. We used binomial exponentiated log-linked general linear models to estimate the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of incident depression after adjusting for age, education, marital status and prevalent medical illnesses. We calculated the probability of depression for each individual combination of risk factors and displayed the results in a risk table.
Two hundred and twenty-nine men (4.5%) showed evidence of incident depression 5.7±0.9 (mean±standard deviation) years later. Measured dietary factors showed no association with incident depression. The probability of depression was the highest for older men who were underweight, overweight or obese, physically inactive, risk drinkers and smokers (12.0%, 95% CI=7.0%, 17.1%), and the lowest for those who had all 4 healthy lifestyle markers: physically active, normal body mass, non-risk drinking and non-smoking (1.6%, 95% CI=0.6%, 2.5%). The probability of incident depression fell between these two extremes for different combinations of lifestyle practices.
Four modifiable lifestyle factors can be used in combination to produce a risk table that predicts the probability of incident depression over a period of 3 to 8 years. The risk table is simple, informative and can be easily incorporated into clinical practice to guide assessment and risk reduction interventions.","['Ageing', 'Depression', 'Elderly', 'Lifestyle', 'Men', 'Mood disorders', 'Prevention', 'Risk factors']",Preventive medicine,10.1016/j.ypmed.2013.09.021,2013-10-10,"[{'lastname': 'Almeida', 'firstname': 'Osvaldo P', 'initials': 'OP', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychiatry & Clinical Neurosciences, University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia; WA Centre for Health & Ageing, Centre for Medical Research, University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia; Department of Psychiatry, Royal Perth Hospital, Perth, Australia.

Fifty-two patients (who are able to ambulate independently) with stage I-II (group early-stage, n= 17) and stage IIIA-IV NSCLC (group advanced-stage, n= 35) were included. Exercise capacity (six minute walking test), strength of the peripheral muscle (Back and Leg Dynamometer), performance status (Karnofsky performance status scale), health-related quality of life- HRQOL (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of life measure and Short Form-36 Health Survey), depression and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) were evaluated.
No difference was found in age, body mass index, respiratory symptoms and the distribution of disease cell types between two groups (p> 0.05). In advanced-stage group, pulmonary function test values, peripheral muscle strength, walking distance and health-related quality of life scores especially the categories of functional capacity and pain were established significantly lower compared to early-stage group (p ≤ 0.05). Depression and anxiety levels were confirmed to be similar between groups (p> 0.05).
The exercise capacity of patients with advanced-stage NSCLC is lower due to reduced pulmonary functions and peripheral muscle strength compared to patients with early-stage NSCLC. Therefore, we can conclude that reduced exercise capacity negatively impacts functional categories of health related quality of life of patients with advanced-stage NSCLC.",[],Tuberkuloz ve toraks,10.5578/tt.5396,2013-07-24,"[{'lastname': 'Yılmaz', 'firstname': 'Elvan', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Dokuz Eylul University School of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation, Izmir, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Özalevli', 'firstname': 'Sevgi', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ersöz', 'firstname': 'Hasan', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Yeğin', 'firstname': 'Ayşe', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Önen', 'firstname': 'Ahmet', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Akkoçlu', 'firstname': 'Atilla', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}]",23875591,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Tuberk Toraks"""
23787796,Baldasseroni et al.,Age-related impact of depressive symptoms on functional capacity measured with 6-minute walking test in coronary artery disease.,"Patients affected by coronary artery disease (CAD) have a high prevalence of depressive disorders. It has been suggested that depressive symptoms significantly reduce exercise stress test performance in CAD patients, whereas their influence on functional capacity tests, such as the 6-minute walking test (6WT), has been less investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between depressive symptoms and 6WT in patients with CAD and the role of age on this relationship.
We enrolled 148 CAD patients. Global functional capacity was measured with 6WT and the presence of depressive symptoms with the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). GDS score was analysed as a continuous variable or categorized as depression absent (score <10), probable (10-14), or present (≤15).
A significant inverse correlation was observed between GDS score and distance walked at 6WT. Patients positive for depressive symptoms (probable or present) had a significantly worse performance compared to those with GDS score <10. In multivariable analysis adjusted for indexes of cardiovascular disease severity and comorbidity, the presence of depressive symptoms proved to be an independent predictor of distance walked at 6WT; the predictivity of depressive symptoms on 6WT was age dependent.
Depressive symptoms negatively affect 6WT performance among older CAD subjects. Non-cardiovascular parameters, such as psycho-affective disorders, must be taken into account for the interpretation of 6WT performance in old age.","['6-minute walking test', 'Aging', 'coronary artery disease', 'depressive disorder']",European journal of preventive cardiology,10.1177/2047487313494581,2013-06-22,"[{'lastname': 'Baldasseroni', 'firstname': 'Samuele', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Pratesi', 'firstname': 'Alessandra', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Orso', 'firstname': 'Francesco', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Foschini', 'firstname': 'Alice', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Marella', 'firstname': 'Andrea Giosafat', 'initials': 'AG', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bartoli', 'firstname': 'Nadia', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Mossello', 'firstname': 'Enrico', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bari', 'firstname': 'Mauro Di', 'initials': 'MD', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Marchionni', 'firstname': 'Niccolò', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tarantini', 'firstname': 'Francesca', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}]",23787796,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Eur J Prev Cardiol"""

In this cross-sectional study, 169 postmenopausal women aged 48 to 68 years were asked to fill out the Wagnild and Young Resilience Scale (WYRS), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD-10), the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS), and a questionnaire containing personal and partner sociodemographic data.
The median [interquartile range] age of participating women was 54 [10.0] years. Among the women, 55.6% had increased body mass index, 76.9% had a partner, 17.8% were current smokers, 14.2% had hypertension, 25.4% used psychotropic drugs, and 13.0% used hormone therapy. Forty-five percent of the women had depressed mood (CESD-10 scores ≥10), and 34.9% had severe menopausal symptoms (total MRS scores ≥17). Less resilience (lower WYRS scores) correlated with depressed mood (higher CESD-10 scores) and severe menopausal symptoms (higher total, psychological, and urogenital MRS scores). Multiple linear regression analysis determined that WYRS scores positively correlated with exercising regularly and inversely correlated with CESD-10 scores (depressed mood). CESD-10 scores positively correlated with somatic and psychological MRS subscale scores and inversely correlated with WYRS scores (less resilience).
In this postmenopausal sample, depressed mood and participation in regular exercise correlate with lower and higher resilience, respectively.

Community-dwelling older women (N=451; age, 65-89y).
The participants were divided into 2 groups: SE and AE. Both protocols lasted 10 weeks, and 30 sessions (1-h sessions) in total were performed 3 times a week under the direct supervision of physical therapists.
Plasma levels of BDNF (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale).
There was a significant difference for BDNF plasma levels between the SE and AE groups (P=.009). Post hoc analysis revealed a pre-post intervention difference in BDNF levels only for the SE group (P=.008). A statistically significant difference was found for the pre- and postintervention Geriatric Depression Scale scores in both groups (P=.001), showing that the effects of both exercise protocols were comparable regarding depressive symptoms (P=.185).
The present findings have demonstrated the positive effect of muscle strengthening and aerobic intervention on depressive symptoms in community-dwelling elderly women. Interestingly, only SE significantly increased the plasma levels of BDNF in our sample.

23220808,Mollaoglu et al.,"Association analyses of depression, anxiety, and physical fitness parameters in Turkish obese adults.","This study aims to investigate the associations among depression, anxiety, aerobic exercise capacity, body fat percentage, sum of skinfolds, abdomen circumference, and waist to hip ratio on the basis of body mass index (BMI) in adults.
The subjects of the study were 60 obese participants (30 women, 30 men) with BMIs over 30 kg/m{2}and 60 healthy controls (30 women, 30 men) with BMIs of 18-25 kg/m{2}. Body fat percentage was calculated from the skinfold thicknesses using the formula. Body circumference measurements were performed using a tape measure. Maximal aerobic capacity (VO(2)max) was determined by Astrand submaximal exercise protocol. Two self-reported questionnaires, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), were administered to all participants.
BMI, body fat percentage, sum of skinfolds, abdomen circumference, and waist to hip ratio were found to be higher in obese groups as compared to the controls, while VO(2)max (ml/kg/min) values were lower in both genders. In males, BAI scores and mild-level anxiety percentage values were higher in the obese group than in the control group. There was no significant difference for BDI scores and levels between the obese and control groups in both genders. There was also no significant difference in BAI scores and levels between the obese and control groups in women.
The fact that physical fitness being found poor in obese shows the existence of a condition that might constitute an increased tendency for obesity-related disorders. In addition, it was suggested that, in Turkey, attitudes toward obesity change depending on gender.",[],Journal of back and musculoskeletal rehabilitation,10.3233/BMR-2012-0333,2012-12-12,"[{'lastname': 'Mollaoglu', 'firstname': 'Hakan', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiology, Afyon Kocatepe University Faculty of Medicine, Afyonkarahisar, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Ucok', 'firstname': 'Kagan', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kaplan', 'firstname': 'Asli', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Genc', 'firstname': 'Abdurrahman', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Mayda', 'firstname': 'Hasan', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Guzel', 'firstname': 'Halil Ibrahim', 'initials': 'HI', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sener', 'firstname': 'Umit', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Uygur', 'firstname': 'Emine', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ozbulut', 'firstname': 'Omer', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': None}]",23220808,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""J Back Musculoskelet Rehabil"""
23194091,Rogerson et al.,"""I don't have the heart"": a qualitative study of barriers to and facilitators of physical activity for people with coronary heart disease and depressive symptoms.","Physical activity has been shown to reduce depression in people with coronary heart disease (CHD), however many people with CHD do not engage in sufficient levels of physical activity to reap its positive effects. People with depression and CHD are at particular risk of non-adherence to physical activity. Little is known about the barriers to and facilitators of physical activity for people with CHD and depressive symptoms. Using qualitative interviews, the aim of this study was to explore the barriers to and facilitators of physical activity for cardiac patients with depressive symptoms.
Fifteen participants with CHD and depressive symptoms (assessed using the Cardiac Depression Scale) participated in in-depth semi-structured interviews. The interviews were focussed on investigating participants' experiences of physical activity since their cardiac event. Interviews were content analysed to determine major themes.
Participants identified a number of barriers to and facilitators of physical activity. Barriers included having negative perceptions towards health and life changes as a result of the cardiac event, having low mood and low motivation to exercise, feeling physically restricted towards or fearful of exercise, lacking knowledge regarding exercise and perceiving external barriers. Facilitators included having a reason for exercising, being able to identify the psychological benefits of exercise, having positive social support and using psychological strategies. 'Inactive' participants reported more barriers and fewer facilitators than did 'active' participants.
The barriers reported in this study were highly salient for a number of participants. Health professionals and researchers can use this information to assist people with CHD and depressive symptoms to identify and possibly overcome barriers to physical activity. Relevant barriers and facilitators could be taken into account to increase their effectiveness when designing interventions to encourage physical activity maintenance in this population.",[],The international journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity,"10.1186/1479-5868-9-140

22959822,Winchester et al.,Walking stabilizes cognitive functioning in Alzheimer's disease (AD) across one year.,"AD is a public health epidemic, which seriously impacts cognition, mood and daily activities; however, one type of activity, exercise, has been shown to alter these states. Accordingly, we sought to investigate the relationship between exercise and mood, in early-stage AD patients (N=104) from California, over a 1-year period. Patients completed the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and Blessed-Roth Dementia Rating Scale (BRDRS), while their caregivers completed the Yale Physical Activity Survey (YALE), Profile of Mood States (POMS), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and Functional Abilities Questionnaire (FAQ). Approximately half of the participants were female, from a variety of ethnic groups (Caucasian=69.8%; Latino/Hispanic Americans=20.1%). Our results demonstrated that the patients spent little time engaged in physical activity in general, their overall activity levels decreased over time, and this was paired with a change in global cognition (e.g., MMSE total score) and affect/mood (e.g., POMS score). Patients were parsed into Active and Sedentary groups based on their Yale profiles, with Active participants engaged in walking activities, weekly, over 1 year. Here, Sedentary patients had a significant decline in MMSE scores, while the Active patients had an attenuation in global cognitive decline. Importantly, among the Active AD patients, those individuals who engaged in walking for more than 2 h/week had a significant improvement in MMSE scores. Structured clinical trials which seek to increase the amount of time AD patients were engaged in walking activities and evaluate the nature and scope of beneficial effects in the brain are warranted.",[],Archives of gerontology and geriatrics,10.1016/j.archger.2012.06.016,2012-09-11,"[{'lastname': 'Winchester', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Memory Impairments & Neurological Disorders, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Dick', 'firstname': 'M B', 'initials': 'MB', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gillen', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Reed', 'firstname': 'B', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Miller', 'firstname': 'B', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tinklenberg', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Mungas', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Chui', 'firstname': 'H', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Galasko', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hewett', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Cotman', 'firstname': 'C W', 'initials': 'CW', 'affiliation': None}]","22959822

22875560,"Chan, Immink, Hillier","Yoga and exercise for symptoms of depression and anxiety in people with poststroke disability: a randomized, controlled pilot trial.","Mood disorders are prevalent in people after stroke, and a disorder's onset can exacerbate stroke-related disabilities. While evidence supports the mental-health benefits of participation in exercise and yoga, it is unknown whether such benefits extend to a population with poststroke hemiparesis.
The study investigated whether supplementing exercise with participation in a yoga program would provide further improvements in self-reported symptoms of depression and anxiety in a chronic poststroke population, and it also assessed trial feasibility for future studies.
The research team designed a randomized, controlled pilot trial that included an exercise-only group (EX, control) and a yoga-and-exercise group (YEX, intervention).
The study took place at the Centre for Physical Activity in Ageing an exercise rehabilitation and activity center at the Royal Adelaide Hospital in South Australia.
The participants included 14 individuals with chronic poststroke hemiparesis: eight in the intervention group and six in the control group.
The YEX group participated in a 6-week standardized program that included yoga in weekly group sessions and home practice in addition to exercise in a weekly group class. The EX group participated only in the group exercise class weekly for 6 weeks.
The research team assessed self-reported symptoms of depression using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS15) and symptoms of anxiety and negative affect using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The team based the feasibility evaluation on recruitment outcomes, retention of participants, participants' compliance with the intervention program, and the safety of the intervention.
Changes in depression and state and trait anxiety did not significantly differ between intervention groups (GDS15 P=.749, STAI-Y1, P=.595, STAI-Y2, P=.407). Comparison of individuals' case results indicated clinically relevant improvements in both groups, although members of the intervention group had greater improvements. Participants reported no adverse events, and the study experienced high retention of participants and high compliance in the yoga program.
This pilot study provides preliminary data on the effects of yoga combined with exercise to influence mood poststroke. It is a feasible, safe, and acceptable intervention, and the field requires additional investigations with a larger sample size.",[],Alternative therapies in health and medicine,,2012-08-10,"[{'lastname': 'Chan', 'firstname': 'Weili', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'University of South Australia, Adelaide.'}, {'lastname': 'Immink', 'firstname': 'Maarten A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hillier', 'firstname': 'Susan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]",22875560,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Altern Ther Health Med"""
22851113,Blumenthal et al.,Effects of exercise training on depressive symptoms in patients with chronic heart failure: the HF-ACTION randomized trial.,"Depression is common in patients with cardiac disease, especially in patients with heart failure, and is associated with increased risk of adverse health outcomes. Some evidence suggests that aerobic exercise may reduce depressive symptoms, but to our knowledge the effects of exercise on depression in patients with heart failure have not been evaluated.
To determine whether exercise training will result in greater improvements in depressive symptoms compared with usual care among patients with heart failure.
Multicenter, randomized controlled trial involving 2322 stable patients treated for heart failure at 82 medical clinical centers in the United States, Canada, and France. Patients who had a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35% or lower, had New York Heart Association class I to IV heart failure, and had completed the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) score were randomized (1:1) between April 2003 and February 2007. Depressive scores ranged from 0 to 59; scores of 14 or higher are considered clinically significant.
Participants were randomized either to supervised aerobic exercise (goal of 90 min/wk for months 1-3 followed by home exercise with a goal of ≥120 min/wk for months 4-12) or to education and usual guideline-based heart failure care.
Composite of death or hospitalization due to any cause and scores on the BDI-II at months 3 and 12.
Over a median follow-up period of 30 months, 789 patients (68%) died or were hospitalized in the usual care group compared with 759 (66%) in the aerobic exercise group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81 to 0.99; P = .03). The median BDI-II score at study entry was 8, with 28% of the sample having BDI-II scores of 14 or higher. Compared with usual care, aerobic exercise resulted in lower mean BDI-II scores at 3 months (aerobic exercise, 8.95; 95% CI, 8.61 to 9.29 vs usual care, 9.70; 95% CI, 9.34 to 10.06; difference, -0.76; 95% CI,-1.22 to -0.29; P = .002) and at 12 months (aerobic exercise, 8.86; 95% CI, 8.67 to 9.24 vs usual care, 9.54; 95% CI, 9.15 to 9.92; difference, -0.68; 95% CI, -1.20 to -0.16; P = .01).
Compared with guideline-based usual care, exercise training resulted in a modest reduction in depressive symptoms, although the clinical significance of this improvement is unknown.

22845485,Redwine et al.,A pilot study exploring the effects of a 12-week t'ai chi intervention on somatic symptoms of depression in patients with heart failure.,"Patients with chronic heart failure (HF) and with elevated depression symptoms are at greater risk of morbidity and mortality. Somatic symptoms of depression are particularly prevalent in HF and are related to worse disease prognosis. T'ai chi practice is related to increased emotional well-being in various clinical populations; however, relatively little is known about t'ai chi's effects on somatic versus cognitive symptom dimensions of depression in HF.
The objective of the study was to measure whether a t'ai chi intervention effectively reduces somatic and/or cognitive symptoms of depression in patients with HF.
Patients with HF were assigned to either t'ai chi training (n=16) or a usual-care group (n=12). At baseline and after the 12-week intervention period, participants were evaluated for changes in depressive symptoms using Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) total scores (BDI-t) and subcategorized scores of BDI-somatic (BDI-s) and BDI-cognitive (BDI-c), and for symptoms of fatigue using the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form.
Patients with HF in the t'ai chi group compared to the usual-care group had reduced BDI-s (p≤0.017), but not BDI-c (p=0.50) scores from pre- to postintervention. Although t'ai chi did not significantly reduce fatigue, changes in physical fatigue (p≤0.05) were independently associated with changes in BDI-t scores.
T'ai chi practice reduced somatic symptoms of depression, which have been linked to worse prognosis in HF. Reductions in fatigue appear to explain some but not all of the reductions in somatic symptoms of depression.",[],"Journal of alternative and complementary medicine (New York, N.Y.)",10.1089/acm.2011.0314,2012-08-01,"[{'lastname': 'Redwine', 'firstname': 'Laura S', 'initials': 'LS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Diego, CA 92093, USA. lredwine@ucsd.edu'}, {'lastname': 'Tsuang', 'firstname': 'Ming', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rusiewicz', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Pandzic', 'firstname': 'Ines', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Cammarata', 'firstname': 'Stephanie', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rutledge', 'firstname': 'Thomas', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hong', 'firstname': 'Suzi', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Linke', 'firstname': 'Sarah', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Mills', 'firstname': 'Paul J', 'initials': 'PJ', 'affiliation': None}]","22845485

22694340,Mystakidou et al.,Geriatric depression in advanced cancer patients: the effect of cognitive and physical functioning.,"The aims of the current study were to evaluate geriatric depression and its risk factors in advanced cancer patients.
A cross-sectional study was carried out in a palliative care unit in Greece. Patients completed the Geriatric Depression Scale, the M. D. Anderson Symptoms Instrument (MDASI), the Activities of Daily Living and the Mini-Mental State Examination. Patients were included if they were aged >65 years, if they had cancer, were able to communicate and had agreed to sign informed consent. The final sample consisted of 92 elderly advanced cancer patients.
The prevalence of depression was found to be 67.4%. The univariate comparison between the depressed elderly and non-depressed group showed that patients with metastases were found to be 2.2-fold more likely to suffer from geriatric depression compared with those without metastases (P = 0.074).

Nine hundred twenty seven randomly selected Finnish men and women aged 65-74 years were included in this study. DS were determined with the Beck Depression Inventory (≥10 points), and lifetime historical LTPA frequency from age 15 years onwards was recalled retrospectively.
The frequency of LTPA was highest at the ages of 15-24 years in both the DS present and not present groups (14.6 times per month). LTPA frequency was significantly lower among those with DS compared with those without DS at the age of 45-54 (10.0 vs. 11.3, p=0.041), 55-64 (9.6 vs. 12.6, p<0.001), and 65-74 (8.6 vs. 11.9, p<0.001). Also the prevalence of somatic diseases was higher for those with DS compared with participants without DS.
This study reveals lifetime LTPA variation and its potential consequences.

22270195,Freixes et al.,Fatigue level in spinal cord injury AIS D community ambulatory subjects.,"Cross-sectional study.
The objective of our study was to determine the level of fatigue in ASIA impairment scale (AIS) D spinal cord injury (SCI) in community ambulatory subjects and correlate fatigue with other clinical symptoms.
Outpatient Rehabilitation Unit, FLENI Institute, Escobar. Buenos Aires, Argentina.
We included twenty-six patients with AIS D SCI that attended therapies at FLENI Institute between 2002 and 2009. We measured the demographic and clinical characteristics of the subjects. All patients were administered the fatigue severity scale (FSS). A cut-score for over four was indicative of significant fatigue. We used the Spearman's coefficient correlation to analyze associations among the FSS with pain (Visual analog scale), depression (Beck depression inventory), and physical activity (hours per week).
The median score of the FSS scale was 2.82 (1-5). Fatigue was found in 5 individuals (19.2%). There was a significant correlation between FSS scale and the Beck questionnaire. No association was found between FSS and pain or physical activity.
The findings of this study suggest that fatigue is a relevant problem for people with SCI AIS D, and is a disabling symptom when present. There is a significant relationship between fatigue and depression.

QoL of MS patients from many European countries has already been assessed but little is known on health-related QoL of Polish subjects with MS. Few studies have taken into consideration multiple predictors of QoL. The aim of this study was to elicit the most relevant factors that determine QoL of Polish group of MS patients. Socio-demographic and clinical factors as well as the influence of disability level were analyzed in this study.
173 MS patients and 86 healthy controls underwent assessment using the Mini Mental Status Examination, WHOQOL-100, Beck Depression Inventory and Fatigue Severity Scale. Data were analyzed by a stepwise linear regression analysis.
MS patients had significantly worse global QoL and worse QoL in physical and psychological health domains, lower level of independence, worse social relations and were less satisfied with the surrounding environment they lived in compared with healthy controls (p<0.05). MS subjects had also higher level of depression and fatigue compared to healthy controls (p<0.05).

The 6 week rehabilitation programme included exercise and self-management education. The hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), the incremental and endurance shuttle walking tests (ISWT/ESWT) were assessed at baseline and after rehabilitation. The number and duration of any CHF admissions in the year before and the year after rehabilitation were also recorded. Improvements in the ISWT, ESWT, and depression were, mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) 60.6 (36.0-85.2) metres, 356.0 (173.0-539.0) seconds (both p≤0.001) and (-)1.0 ((-)1.8-(-)0.2) points (p<0.05), respectively.

These programs have typically been provided in clinical facilities, health clubs, and senior centers, which may be inconvenient and/or cost prohibitive for some older adults. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of an automated telemedicine intervention that provides real-time guidance and monitoring of resistance training in the home.
A randomized clinical trial in 103 middle-aged or older participants. Participants were assigned to use of a theory-driven interactive voice response system designed to promote resistance training (Telephone-Linked Computer-based Long-term Interactive Fitness Trainer; n = 52) or to an attention control (n = 51) for a period of 12 months. Measurements of muscle strength, balance, walk distance, and mood were obtained at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months.
We observed increased strength, improved balance, and fewer depressive symptoms in the intervention group than in the control group. Using generalized estimating equations modeling, group differences were statistically significant for knee flexion strength (p = .035), single-leg stance time (p = .029), and Beck Depression Inventory (p = .030).
This computer-based telecommunications exercise intervention led to improvements in participants' strength, balance, and depressive symptoms. Because of their low cost and easy accessibility, computer-based interventions may be a cost-effective way of promoting exercise in the home.",[],"The journals of gerontology.

Randomised trial.
51 people with clinically stable chronic heart failure were randomised into an experimental group (n=24) or a control group (n=27).
The experimental group undertook an individualised home-based exercise program, 30 minutes per session, 3 sessions per week for 8 weeks, with regular telephone follow-up and consultations. The control group maintained their usual activity during this period.
The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, six-minute walk test, Groningen Activity Restriction Scale, and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire were administered at baseline and 8 weeks.
At baseline, anxiety and depression were inversely moderately correlated with walking distance, activity, and quality of life.

21602759,Murtezani et al.,"A comparison of high intensity aerobic exercise and passive modalities for the treatment of workers with chronic low back pain: a randomized, controlled trial.","In recent years, disability due to chronic low back pain (LBP) has steadily increased in all industrialized countries. In the treatment of chronic LBP, the objectives are to reduce pain, to improve function and minimize avoiding behavior. Exercise therapy is a management strategy that is widely used as a treatment for LBP.
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of high- intensity aerobic exercise on pain, disability, anxiety or depression in people with chronic LBP.
This was a randomized controlled trial
Institute of Occupational Medicine, Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation - Outpatient Ward
Kosovo power plant workers.
Participants with chronic low back pain, excluding those with ""red flag"" criteria were assigned randomly to one of the two treatment groups: an aerobic exercise group (N.=50), and an passive modalities group (N.=51). Data on low back pain intensity (visual analogue scale), disability (Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire), fingertip-to-floor distance, and psychosocial factors (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) were collected at baseline and after 12-weeks follow-up points.
At 12-week follow-up, significant improvements in pain intensity and disability had occurred in the exercise group. We have verified significant improvements in comparison with basic values in pain intensity (6 ± 2.6 vs. 2 ± 1.7, diff. of mean=3.9, P < 0.001), disability (31 ± 17.4 vs. 15.8 ± 12.7, diff. of mean=15.2, P<0.001), anxiety and depression (21.1 ± 8.2 vs. 14 ± 6.7, diff. of mean=7.1, P < 0.001), and fingertip- to-floor distance (27.8 ± -9.1 vs. 14.2 ± -5.7, P<0.001). Whereas, differences in average pain, disability, anxiety and depression and fingertip-to-floor distance are not significant in the control group.
High intensity aerobic exercise reduces pain, disability and psychological strain in patients with chronic low back pain.
This research is important for the fact that High Intensity Aerobic Exercise Programs are not so exploited in the current available literature for the treatment of LBP. Therefore, this is another modest contribution which can reinforce the need for more frequent use of High Intensity Aerobic Exercise Programs in the treatment of LBP.",[],European journal of physical and rehabilitation medicine,,2011-05-24,"[{'lastname': 'Murtezani', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinic, University Clinical Center of Kosovo, Prishtina, Republic of Kosovo. ardianaa@yahoo.com'}, {'lastname': 'Hundozi', 'firstname': 'H', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Orovcanec', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sllamniku', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Osmani', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}]",21602759,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Eur J Phys Rehabil Med"""

Fifty-eight Puerto Rican adults were randomly assigned to supervised PRT (n = 29) or a control group (n = 29). A secondary analyses were conducted, and 2 mental health outcomes, the Geriatric Depression Scale and the SF-36 mental component summary score, were used to assess the impact of PRT on mental health status. At baseline, no differences were found on measures of self-reported mental health status.
PRT participants had significantly improved mental health status at follow-up (16 weeks).

21478777,Piette et al.,A randomized trial of telephonic counseling plus walking for depressed diabetes patients.,"Patients with diabetes and depression often have self-management needs that require between-visit support. This study evaluated the impact of telephone-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting patients' management of depressive symptoms, physical activity levels, and diabetes-related outcomes.
Two hundred ninety-one patients with type 2 diabetes and significant depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory scores ≥ 14) were recruited from a community-based, university-based, and Veterans Affairs health care systems. A manualized telephone CBT program was delivered weekly by nurses for 12 weeks, followed by 9 monthly booster sessions. Sessions initially focused exclusively on patients' depression management and then added a pedometer-based walking program. The primary outcome was hemoglobin A1c levels measured at 12 months. Blood pressure was a secondary outcome; levels of physical activity were determined by pedometer readings; depression, coping, and health-related quality of life were measured using standardized scales.
Baseline A1c levels were relatively good and there was no difference in A1c at follow-up. Intervention patients experienced a 4.26 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure relative to controls (P=0.05). Intervention patients had significantly greater increases in step counts (mean difference, 1131 steps/d; P=0.0002) and greater reductions in depressive symptoms (58% remitted at 12 mo vs. 39%; P=0.002). Intervention patients also experienced relative improvements in coping and health-related quality of life.
This program of telephone-delivered CBT combined with a pedometer-based walking program did not improve A1c values, but significantly decreased patients' blood pressure, increased physical activity, and decreased depressive symptoms. The intervention also improved patients' functioning and quality of life.",[],Medical care,10.1097/MLR.0b013e318215d0c9,2011-04-12,"[{'lastname': 'Piette', 'firstname': 'John D', 'initials': 'JD', 'affiliation': 'Ann Arbor VA Healthcare System, Flint, MI, USA. jpiette@umich.edu'}, {'lastname': 'Richardson', 'firstname': 'Caroline', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Himle', 'firstname': 'Joseph', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Duffy', 'firstname': 'Sonia', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Torres', 'firstname': 'Trissa', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Vogel', 'firstname': 'Mark', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barber', 'firstname': 'Kimberly', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Valenstein', 'firstname': 'Marcia', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}]","21478777

21138387,"Man, Tsang, Hui-Chan",Do older t'ai chi practitioners have better attention and memory function?,"Cognitive declines are common in older people and can be a major health issue in an aging world. One type of body-mind exercises, t'ai chi, can be a possible means to help maintaining older adults' cognitive abilities, in addition to beneficial effects of physical exercises. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether t'ai chi practitioners had better attention and memory functions than older people with or without regular exercises.
A cross-sectional study examining the relationship between t'ai chi practice and age-, gender- and education-similar older peoples' attention and memory functions. Forty-two (42) community-dwelling elderly subjects, aged 60 or older, recruited from t'ai chi clubs in Hong Kong formed the t'ai chi group. Another 49 elderly having regular exercise habits were recruited from community centers for inclusion in the exercise group. A nonexercise group (normal healthy control) consisting of 44 subjects were also recruited by random selection and through contacting local elderly centers. They were also screened by the Modified Barthel Index, Chinese Mini-mental Status Examination, Geriatric Depression Scale, and evaluated by attention tests (Color Trail Form A-1 and 2) and memory tests (including Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test and The Hong Kong List Learning Test).
The main finding was that the three groups differed in attention and memory functions, and the t'ai chi group had demonstrated better performance than the other two groups in most subtests.
As a causal relationship cannot be assumed in the present cross-sectional study, future research is required to examine how t'ai chi can improve cognitive function using a randomized control trial as well as determining whether t'ai chi practice can lead to better health status among elderly people.",[],"Journal of alternative and complementary medicine (New York, N.Y.)",10.1089/acm.2009.0462,2010-12-09,"[{'lastname': 'Man', 'firstname': 'David W K', 'initials': 'DW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong.

21064116,Morghen et al.,Moderate to severe depressive symptoms and rehabilitation outcome in older adults with hip fracture.,"To evaluate if depressive symptoms affect recovery of walking ability and 1-year institutionalization or mortality in older adults who underwent post-hip fracture (HF) surgery rehabilitation.
Depressive symptoms were assessed on admission using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), with scores ≥10/15 indicating moderate to severe depressive symptoms. Multidimensional assessment included Mini Mental State Examination, Charlson Comorbidity Index, Body Mass Index, albumin serum levels, number of drugs, antidepressants and Barthel Index (BI) on admission and at discharge. Walking ability was evaluated using the BI walking sub-item referred to 1 month before HF, on admission, and at discharge. Patients scoring ≤3/15 BI walking sub-item on admission (i.e. those fully dependent or requiring major supervision in walking) were included. Walking independence at discharge was defined as a score ≥12/15 at the BI walking sub-item.
In multivariate analyses, after adjustment for covariates and potential confounders, patients with moderate to severe depressive symptoms were more likely to fail walking independence at discharge (odds ratio, OR = 3.2; 95% CI = 1.3 to 7.8; p = 0.010) and to be institutionalized or died at 1 year (OR = 3.6, 95% CI = 1.4 to 9.1, p = 0.007). In further analyses, the failure to recover walking independence at discharge partly mediates the relationship between moderate to severe depressive symptoms and 1-year adverse events.

To examine the bidirectional relationship between physical activity and common mental disorders and establish the importance of context, type and intensity of activity undertaken.
A clinical examination of 40 401 residents of Norway was undertaken. Participants answered questions relating to the frequency and intensity of both leisure-time and workplace activity. Depression and anxiety were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Biological and social data were also collected.
There was an inverse relationship between the amount of leisure-time physical activity and case-level symptoms of depression. This cross-sectional association was only present with leisure-time (as opposed to workplace) activity and was not dependent on the intensity of activities undertaken. Higher levels of social support and social engagement were important in explaining the relationship between leisure activity and depression. Biological changes such as alterations to parasympathetic vagal tone (resting pulse) and changes to metabolic markers had a less important role.
Individuals who engage in regular leisure-time activity of any intensity are less likely to have symptoms of depression.

The purpose of this study was to identify the contributing factors of exertion fatigue and chronic fatigue in people post-stroke.
Twenty-one post-stroke people (12 males, 9 females; 59.5 ± 10.3 years of age; time after stroke 4.1 ± 3.5 years) participated in the study. The response variables included exertion fatigue and chronic fatigue. Participants underwent a standardized fatigue-inducing exercise on a recumbent stepper. Exertion fatigue level was assessed at rest and immediately after exercise using the Visual Analog Fatigue Scale. Chronic fatigue was measured by the Fatigue Severity Scale. The explanatory variables included aerobic fitness, motor control, and depressive symptoms measured by peak oxygen uptake, Fugl-Meyer motor score, and the Geriatric Depression Scale, respectively.
Using forward stepwise regression, we found that peak oxygen uptake was an independent predictor of exertion fatigue (P = 0.006), whereas depression was an independent predictor of chronic fatigue (P = 0.002).

20861176,Konttinen et al.,Emotional eating and physical activity self-efficacy as pathways in the association between depressive symptoms and adiposity indicators.,"There is increasing evidence that depressive symptoms and obesity are positively related, but the mechanisms that explain the association between them are unclear.
We examined direct and indirect associations between depressive symptoms, emotional eating, physical activity (PA) self-efficacy (ie, an individual's confidence in his or her ability to overcome barriers to maintain PA behaviors), and adiposity indicators.
Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesized mediation model in Finnish men (n = 2312) and women (n = 2674) aged 25-74 y from the National Cardiovascular Risk Factor Survey conducted in 2007. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale, the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire-R18, and a PA barriers self-efficacy scale were used. Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and percentage body fat of participants were measured in a health examination.
Depressive symptoms and emotional eating had positive correlations and PA self-efficacy had negative correlations with BMI, WC, and percentage body fat. Elevated depressive symptoms were related to higher emotional eating (β = 0.38 for men and 0.31 for women) and lower PA self-efficacy (β = -0.41 for men and -0.31 for women), whereas emotional eating and PA self-efficacy were inversely correlated (r = -0.12 and -0.18, respectively). The positive bivariate associations between depressive symptoms and adiposity indicators became nonsignificant in models that included emotional eating and PA self-efficacy, and both of these factors significantly mediated the effects of depressive symptoms on adiposity indicators.
Psychological factors related to both eating and PA may be relevant in explaining the positive relation between depressive symptoms and adiposity.

20808136,Saarloos et al.,The built environment and depression in later life: the health in men study.,"This study examined the impact of built environment (BE) attributes on depression in older men to determine whether associations were independent of neighborhood composition factors and sociodemographic, psychosocial, and health factors at the individual level.
The authors used geocoded data from the Health in Men Study collected in Western Australia in 2001 (N = 5,218). Depression was measured using the self-rated 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale. Geographic Information Systems were used to objectively measure BE attributes. Univariate logistic regressions were applied to select relevant covariates. Multivariate logistic regressions were conducted to examine BE attributes both separately and conjointly.
Higher degrees of land-use mix were associated with higher odds of depression independent of other factors, including street connectivity and residential density (odds ratio = 1.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10-2.16, and odds ratio = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.08-2.14 for the second and third tertiles, respectively). Further examination showed that retail availability was associated with a 40% increase in the odds of depression (95% CI = 4%-90%) independent of other factors, including availability of other land uses.

20738450,Yohannes et al.,"The long-term benefits of cardiac rehabilitation on depression, anxiety, physical activity and quality of life.","To investigate the long-term benefits of a six-week comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation programme on physical activity, psychological well-being and quality of life in patients with coronary heart disease.
Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) in short term improves exercise capacity and quality of life in patients with cardiac disease. However, the long-term benefits of CR are inconclusive.
A prospective CR programme with repeated measures follow-up over 12 months.
A six-week outpatient cardiac rehabilitation programme was conducted including 147 patients with coronary heart disease. Patients completed the physical activity energy expenditure (seven-day recall activity), MacNew Heart Disease Health-Related Quality of Life (MacNew) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADs) at baseline, six weeks, six and 12 months.
One hundred and five (71%) patients (76 male) mean age of 61.8 (SD 9.7) completed the four-measurement points. Analysis of variance revealed that total energy expenditure (F (2, 231) = 131, p < 0.001), HADs (F (2, 237) = 19.3, p < 0.001), depression score (F (2, 235) = 21.06, p < 0.001), anxiety score (F (2,237) = 17.02, p < 0.001) and MacNew (F (2, 197) = 77.02, p < 0.001) were all statistically significant over time. Bonferroni pairwise follow-up confirmed significant positive differences (p < 0.05) between baseline values and all subsequent measures over time. Depression was independently explained in 22% of the variance in quality of life at 6 or 12 months. The energy expenditure was significantly higher for men compared to women (F (1, 103) = 31, p < 0.001).
A six-week cardiac rehabilitation programme is beneficial in improving quality of life, physical activity status, anxiety and depression. These benefits were maintained at 12 months. Elevated levels of depression were associated with impaired quality of life.
All relevant health care staff should be aware of the benefits of CR and routinely refer and encourage patients with cardiac disease to attend a cardiac rehabilitation programme. Depression and anxiety intervention strategies should be incorporated in cardiac rehabilitation programmes.",[],Journal of clinical nursing,10.1111/j.1365-2702.2010.03313.x,2010-08-27,"[{'lastname': 'Yohannes', 'firstname': 'Abebaw M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Manchester Metropolitan University-Physiotherapy, Elizabeth Gaskell Campus, Manchester, Lancashire, UK.

20670378,Smith et al.,Effect of walking distance on 8-year incident depressive symptoms in elderly men with and without chronic disease: the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study.,"To determine the effect of walking on incident depressive symptoms in elderly Japanese-American men with and without chronic disease.
Prospective cohort study.
The Honolulu-Asia Aging Study.
Japanese-American men aged 71 to 93 at baseline.
Physical activity was assessed according to self-reported distance walked per day. Depressive symptoms were measured using an 11-question version of the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D 11) at the fourth examination (n=3,196) and at the seventh examination 8 years later (1999/00, n=1,417). Presence of incident depressive symptoms was defined as a CES-D 11 score of 9 or greater or taking antidepressants at Examination 7. Subjects with prevalent depressive symptoms at baseline were excluded.
Age-adjusted 8-year incident depressive symptoms were 13.6%, 7.6%, and 8.5% for low (<0.25 miles/day), intermediate (0.25-1.5 miles/day), and high (>1.5 miles/day) walking groups at baseline (P=0.008). Multiple logistic regression analyses, adjusted for age, education, marital status, cardiovascular risk factors, prevalent diseases, and functional impairment, showed that those in the intermediate and highest walking groups had significantly lower odds of developing 8-year incident depressive symptoms (odds ratio (OR)=0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.32-0.83, P=.006 and OR=0.61, 95% CI= 0.39-0.97, P=.04, respectively). Analysis found that this association was significant only in participants without chronic diseases (coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular accident, cancer, Parkinson's disease, dementia, or cognitive impairment) at baseline.

20515892,"Heesch, Burton, Brown","Concurrent and prospective associations between physical activity, walking and mental health in older women.","Leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) shows promise for reducing the risk of poor mental health in later life, although gender- and age-specific research is required to clarify this association. This study examined the concurrent and prospective relationships between both LTPA and walking with mental health in older women.
Community-dwelling women aged 73-78 years completed mailed surveys in 1999, 2002 and 2005 for the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health. Respondents reported their weekly minutes of walking, moderate LTPA and vigorous LTPA. Mental health was defined as the number of depression and anxiety symptoms, as assessed with the Goldberg Anxiety and Depression Scale (GADS). Multivariable linear mixed models, adjusted for socio-demographic and health-related variables, were used to examine associations between five levels of LTPA (none, very low, low, intermediate and high) and GADS scores. For women who reported walking as their only LTPA, associations between walking and GADS scores were also examined. Women who reported depression or anxiety in 1999 were excluded, resulting in data from 6,653 women being included in these analyses.
Inverse dose-response associations were observed between both LTPA and walking with GADS scores in concurrent and prospective models (p<0.001). Even low levels of LTPA and walking were associated with lowered scores. The lowest scores were observed in women reporting high levels of LTPA or walking.
The results support an inverse dose-response association between both LTPA and walking with mental health, over 3 years in older women without depression or anxiety.",[],Journal of epidemiology and community health,10.1136/jech.2009.103077,2010-06-03,"[{'lastname': 'Heesch', 'firstname': 'Kristiann C', 'initials': 'KC', 'affiliation': 'Queensland University of Technology, School of Public Health, Brisbane, Queensland 4059, Australia. k.heesch@qut.edu.au'}, {'lastname': 'Burton', 'firstname': 'Nicola W', 'initials': 'NW', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Brown', 'firstname': 'Wendy J', 'initials': 'WJ', 'affiliation': None}]",20515892,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,DENIED:  url (http://jech.bmj.com/content/65/9/807.full.pdf) did not result in a PDF
20464340,Deslandes et al.,Effect of aerobic training on EEG alpha asymmetry and depressive symptoms in the elderly: a 1-year follow-up study.,"The effect of physical exercise on the treatment of depressive elderly adults has not been investigated thus far in terms of changes in cortical hemispheric activity. The objective of the present study was to identify changes in depressive symptoms, quality of life, and cortical asymmetry produced by aerobic activity. Elderly subjects with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (DSM-IV) were included. Twenty patients (70% females, 71 +/- 3 years) were divided into an exercise group (pharmacological treatment plus aerobic training) and a control group (undergoing pharmacological treatment) in a quasi-experimental design. Pharmacological treatment was maintained stable throughout the study (antidepressants and anxiolytics). Subjects were evaluated by depression scales (Beck Depression Inventory, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale) and the Short Form Health Survey-36, and electroencephalographic measurements (frontal and parietal alpha asymmetry) before and after 1 year of treatment. After 1 year, the control group showed a decrease in cortical activity on the right hemisphere (increase of alpha power), which was not observed in the exercise group. The exercise group showed a significant decrease of depressive symptoms, which was not observed in the control group. This result was also accompanied by improved treatment response and remission rate after 1 year of aerobic exercise associated with treatment. This study provides support for the effect of aerobic training on alpha activity and on depressive symptoms in elderly patients.

Look AHEAD participants (n = 5,145; age 58.7 +/- 6.8 years; BMI 35.8 +/- 5.8 kg/m(2)) were assessed for CVD risk factors (elevated HbA(1c) or insulin use, elevated BP or antihypertensive use, elevated lipid levels or lipid-lowering medication, current smoking, BMI > or = 30 kg/m(2), lower peak exercise capacity assessed as metabolic equivalents [METs], and ankle-brachial index <0.9 or >1.3). Participants also completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and reported their use of ADMs.
Of the participants, 14.7% had BDI scores > or = 11, consistent with mild-moderate depression, and 16.5% took ADMs; 4.4% had both depression markers (i.e. elevated symptom scores and took ADMs). In logistic regression analyses of CVD risk (elevated risk factor or use of medication to control the risk factor), controlled for demographic factors, continuous BDI scores and ADM use were each independently associated with elevated BP (or medication), current smoking, BMI > or = 30 kg/m(2) and lower MET values. ADM use was also associated with elevated serum lipids or use of lipid-lowering medication.
Among Look AHEAD participants, depression symptoms or ADM use on entry to the study were each independently associated with a wide range of CVD risk factors. Future research should assess the temporal dynamics of the relationships of depression symptoms and ADM use with CVD risk factors.

12 weeks randomized pilot trial of either individualized Cognition-Action program (n = 24) or routine medical care as control (C, n = 25).
Long-term care (LTC) of the Geriatric Department from the University State Hospital in Bordeaux, France.
49 institutionalized old patients with at least one Neuropsychiatric symptoms > or =4.
The CA rationale was a non-preconceived ideas approach over the patient's abilities and discourse. Patients received short bouts of 5-15 min and accumulated 50 min of interaction per week. CA intervention used five standardized exercises as tools to enhance communication and social interactions. CA was compared to usual care.
Primary outcomes were the Neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) total and symptoms scores. Secondary outcomes were the BERG balance scale, the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Quality of life AM-PAC-CAT and Muscle strength.
The CA group had a clinically significant NPI total score reduction compared to C, -7, 95%CI [-10.8 to -3], eta2 = 0.24.

A pretest-posttest experimental research design with a control group was used. The sample consisted of 26 women in the exercise group and 22 women in the wait-list control group in Seoul, Korea.
The measures of physical fitness included body mass index, cardiopulmonary endurance (blood pressure and heart rate), muscle strength (hand grip strength), flexibility (degree of bending of the upper body), and balance (duration of time for which the subject could stand on one foot). Depression and self-efficacy were measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale and a modified form of Lee's scale, respectively. All measures were obtained twice: at baseline and at the completion of the exercise program.
The exercise program consisted of 4 weeks of education along with 8 weeks of physical exercise.
After the intervention, significant improvements were found in depression, self-efficacy, and all measures of physical fitness, except heart rate and flexibility, in the experimental group.

19801939,von Känel et al.,Relation of heart rate recovery to psychological distress and quality of life in patients with chronic heart failure.,"Psychological distress, poor disease-specific quality of life (QoL), and reduction in vagally mediated early heart rate recovery (HRR) after exercise, all previously predicted morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). We hypothesized lower HRR with greater psychological distress and poorer QoL in CHF.
All assessments were made at the beginning of a comprehensive cardiac outpatient rehabilitation intervention program.
Fifty-six CHF patients (mean 58+/-12 years, 84% men) completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire. HRR was determined as the difference between HR at the end of exercise and 1 min after exercise termination (HRR-1).
Elevated levels of anxiety symptoms (P=0.005) as well as decreased levels of the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire total (P = 0.025), physical (P=0.026), and emotional (P=0.017) QoL were independently associated with blunted HRR-1. Anxiety, total, physical, and emotional QoL explained 11.4, 8, 7.8, and 9.0%, respectively, of the variance after controlling for covariates. Depressed mood was not associated with HRR-1 (P=0.20).
Increased psychological distress with regard to elevated anxiety symptoms and impaired QoL were independent correlates of reduced HRR-1 in patients with CHF.

This pilot study investigated the feasibility of an exercise intervention for depressed female smokers (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale [CES-D] score > or =16).
Participants (M = 41 years, 98% White) were randomized to 10 weeks of individually delivered exercise counseling (n = 30) or a health education contact control condition (n = 30). All participants received nicotine patch therapy and behavioral counseling for smoking cessation.
The intervention was feasible as indicated by ability to recruit participants, exercise counseling session attendance (M = 7.6 of 10 sessions attended), and significant increase in exercise frequency and stage of change from baseline to end of treatment (EOT) (Week 10). Participant attrition rate was 35% by Week 10 but did not differ significantly between groups. Smoking abstinence rates at Week 10, using intention-to-treat analysis, were 17% for exercise counseling participants and 23% for health education participants (p = .75).

Psychological and physiologic factors relevant to HF were assessed in HF-ACTION, a large randomized study of aerobic exercise training in patients with systolic HF. The relation of objective and subjective parameters was compared with scores on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) to examine the hypothesis that depressive symptoms are better associated with perception of disease severity than with objective markers of HF severity. At baseline, 2,322 of 2,331 subjects entered into HF-ACTION completed questionnaires to assess depression (BDI) and quality of life (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire [KCCQ]). Objective markers of HF severity included ejection fraction, B-type natriuretic peptide, and peak oxygen consumption (using cardiopulmonary exercise testing, with evaluation of duration and respiratory exchange ratio also performed). Measures more likely to be affected by perceived functional status included New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification and the 6-minute walk test. Objective assessments of disease severity were slightly related (peak oxygen consumption) or not related (B-type natriuretic peptide and ejection fraction) to BDI scores. Using multivariate analysis (KCCQ not included), only age, gender, cardiopulmonary exercise testing duration, NYHA class, 6-minute walk distance, and peak respiratory exchange ratio independently correlated with BDI scores. In conclusion, depression was minimally related to objective assessments of severity of disease in patients with HF, but was associated with patient (and clinician) perceptions of disease severity.

A total of 710 men and women, aged 65 years and over, participated in the study. Katz's Index and the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology Index of Competence were used to measure the functional capacities of basic activities of daily living (BADL) and higher-level competence, respectively. For the purpose of analysis, a decline in each subscale of functional capacity during the follow-up period were used as outcome variables; depression status assessed by the Japanese version of the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), with a cut-off of 11, was used as an independent variable; and age, gender, education level, history of chronic disease, hospitalization, smoking, physical activity, living alone, hearing problems, physical pain, dietary habits, and usual walking speed at baseline were used as covariates.
Use of the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for potential confounders showed that depression status was significantly and independently associated with BADL decline (risk ratio (RR) = 1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13-1.89) and with higher-level competence decline (RR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.18-2.04).

Thirty-eight male HF patients and 19 male control subjects (mean age +/- SEM: 55.5 +/- 1.9) completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) before undergoing a moderate 20-minute bicycle exercise at approximately 65% to 70% VO(2peak). Plasma levels of the soluble adhesion molecules P-selectin (sP-selectin) (sCD62P) and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) were determined immediately before and after and 10 minutes after exercise.
Higher BDI scores moderated greater increases in sP-selectin levels in response to exercise over time in HF patients as compared with control subjects [F(1.8/84.5) = 3.25, p = .05]. Post hoc testing revealed that in HF patients, but not in control subjects, higher BDI scores were significantly associated with greater increases in sP-selectin levels over time in response to exercise [BDI by exercise interaction: F(1.6/49.6) = 5.67, p = .010]. Also, in HF patients, but not in control subjects, higher BDI scores were associated with higher sP-selectin levels at pre-exercise and postexercise time points [main effect BDI: F(1/31) = 4.86, p = .035].

Longitudinal randomized clinical trial.
A National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center in the southeastern United States.
20 women (aged 55 years or older) with breast cancer receiving hormonal treatment.
Participants were randomized to a walking exercise intervention or usual care. Laboratory samples and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Piper Revised Fatigue Scale, and the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale were collected at the initial clinic visit and at 12 weeks from the groups. Questionnaires also were collected at weeks 2 and 14.
Fatigue, sleep disturbances, depressive symptoms, biomarkers, and exercise.
Effect of the exercise intervention on sleep scores was highly significant between groups. Exercise group scores on the PSQI decreased significantly over time (indicating improved sleep quality), although scores did not change significantly within the control group. Sleep actigraphy also showed significantly shorter actual wake time and less movement in the exercise group. Serotonin levels also were significantly affected by the intervention.

18503493,Rosqvist et al.,Factors affecting the increased risk of physical inactivity among older people with depressive symptoms.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between depressive symptoms and physical inactivity, and whether motives for and barriers to exercise explain the potential association between depressive symptoms and physical inactivity in older people. The design of the study was cross-sectional. The study population comprised 645 people born between 1922 and 1928 who were residents in a city-center area of Jyväskylä in central Finland. Depressive symptoms were assessed using Center for the Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, physical activity using Grimby's (1986) validated scale, and motives for and barriers to exercise using a questionnaire and mobility limitation with a test of walking time over 10 m. The results demonstrated that the risk of physical inactivity was more than twofold among persons with depressive symptoms compared with non-depressed people. A higher prevalence of perceived barriers to physical activity, such as poor health, fear and negative experiences, together with lack of knowledge, explained part of the increased risk of physical inactivity among those with depressive symptoms while differences in motives for physical activity did not have a material effect. Adjustment for walking time over 10 m attenuated the increased risk of inactivity further. When planning exercise promotion programs, finding ways to overcome fear and negative experiences and providing information may help to increase physical activity among people with depressive symptoms. Additionally, difficulties caused by poor mobility should not be ignored.",[],Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports,10.1111/j.1600-0838.2008.00798.x,2008-05-28,"[{'lastname': 'Rosqvist', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Sciences and the Finnish Centre for Interdisciplinary Gerontology, University of Jyväskylä, Jyväskylä, Finland. eerika.rosqvist@kolumbus.fi'}, {'lastname': 'Heikkinen', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lyyra', 'firstname': 'T-M', 'initials': 'TM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hirvensalo', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kallinen', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Leinonen', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rasinaho', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Pakkala', 'firstname': 'I', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rantanen', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}]",18503493,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,DENIED: Wiley E Publisher says no to https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0838.2008.00798.x/pdf
18501008,Kerse et al.,DeLLITE depression in late life: an intervention trial of exercise. Design and recruitment of a randomised controlled trial.,"Physical activity shows potential in combating the poor outcomes associated with depression in older people. Meta-analyses show gaps in the research with poor trial design compromising certainty in conclusions and few programmes showing sustained effects.
The Depression in Late Life: an Intervention Trial of Exercise (DeLLITE) is a 12 month randomised controlled trial of a physical activity intervention to increase functional status in people aged 75 years and older with depressive symptoms. The intervention involves an individualised activity programme based on goal setting and progression of difficulty of activities delivered by a trained nurse during 8 home visits over 6 months. The control group received time matched home visits to discuss social contacts and networks. Baseline, 6 and 12 months measures were assessed in face to face visits with the primary outcome being functional status (SPPB, NEADL). Secondary outcomes include depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale), quality of life (SF-36), physical activity (AHS Physical Activity Questionnaire) and falls (self report).
Due to report in 2008 the DeLLITE study has recruited 70% of those eligible and tests the efficacy of a home based, goal setting physical activity programme in improving function, mood and quality of life in older people with depressive symptomatology. If successful in improving function and mood this trial could prove for the first time that there are long term health benefit of physical activity, independent of social activity, in this high risk group who consume excess health related costs.

Patients (n = 205) were identified from 2 ongoing studies involving PAD, who completed the Geriatric Depression Scale, a 6-minute walk, and the social cognitive measures of interest: pain acceptance, self-efficacy, desire for physical competence, perceived control for walking, and satisfaction with function. Psychometric support for each measure included factor analyses, test-retest reliability, and an evaluation of construct validity by investigating how each measure was related to depression and performance on the 6-minute walk test.
The measures of interest had good structural integrity, were reliable, and shared expected variance with depressed affect; most had significant linear trends with the 6-minute walk test, suggesting that compromised psychological status is related to poorer mobility.
Constructs from social cognitive theory are clearly relevant to the promotion of physical activity in PAD patients. To this end, this study offers measures of relevant constructs that can now be implemented into intervention research.",[],Journal of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation and prevention,10.1097/01.HCR.0000311512.61967.6e,2008-02-19,"[{'lastname': 'Rejeski', 'firstname': 'W Jack', 'initials': 'WJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health and Exercise Science, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC 27109, USA. rejeski@wfu.edu'}, {'lastname': 'Tian', 'firstname': 'Lu', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Liao', 'firstname': 'Yihua', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'McDermott', 'firstname': 'Mary M', 'initials': 'MM', 'affiliation': None}]",18277834,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""J Cardiopulm Rehabil Prev"""

Outcomes (service utilization, clinical outcomes, self-care ability, and depressive symptoms) were assessed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after discharge. Self-care ability (ability to perform activities of daily living [ADLs]), was measured by the Chinese Barthel Index. Depressive symptoms were measured by the Chinese Geriatric Depression Scale, short form.
The experimental group (n = 80) had a significantly better ADL trajectory than the control group (n = 82) during the 1st year after discharge (p =.002). More participants in the experimental group than in the control group recovered their previous walking ability both at 6 months (81% vs 58%, respectively) and 12 months (84% vs 66%, respectively) after discharge. Overall, the odds ratio for the experimental group recovering their previous walking ability was 2.72 (p <.001) compared to the control group. The experimental group had significantly fewer depressive symptoms than the control group during the 1st year following discharge (p =.004).

Cross-sectional study conducted 3 years after stroke.
A total of 102 patients after first-ever stroke following inpatient rehabilitation who are now living in the community.
Community ambulation was determined by a self-administered questionnaire with 4 categories. Gait speed was assessed by the 5-m walking test. Possible confounding factors included in the analyses were: age, hemisphere, living alone, history of falls, use of assistive walking devices, executive function (Trail Making Test), depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale), fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale), motor function (Motricity Index), standing balance (Berg Balance Scale) and walking endurance (SF36).
Twenty-six percent of the patients were non-community walkers or limited community walkers. The optimal cut-off point for community ambulation was 0.66 m/sec, with an area under the curve of 0.85. Although gait speed was significantly related to community ambulation, this association was confounded by balance, motor function, endurance and the use of an assistive walking device. These factors reduced the regression coefficient of gait speed by more than 15%.

A convenience sample of 52 women (mean age 66.31 years, range 53-79 years) who had uncomplicated CABG surgery was selected from two tertiary hospitals in Sydney. A descriptive design was used with information related to post-operative problems collected by telephone interview at 1, 3 and 6 weeks post discharge using a semistructured questionnaire. Psychological distress was assessed at 12 weeks post discharge using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Responses were categorised, collapsed and described using frequencies and percentages. Relationships were assessed by Spearman's r. The most common problems in the first and third weeks post discharge were sleeplessness and nausea or poor appetite and chest incision pain. Although problems improved over the first 6 weeks post-operatively, approximately one-quarter of the women still reported chest incision pain and almost 40% reported problems with leg wounds and oedema. The number of problems experienced at 6 weeks was significantly correlated with depression at 12 weeks.

17975846,Bots et al.,Lifestyle- and diet-related factors in late-life depression--a 5-year follow-up of elderly European men: the FINE study.,"Late-life depression is one of the main health problems among elderly populations and a key element of healthy ageing. Causal relationships of lifestyle- and diet-related factors in late-life depression are unclear. This study investigates prospective associations of lifestyle- and diet-related factors with development of categorically defined late-life depression in a well-documented population of elderly European men.
Altogether 526 not-demented and not-depressed European men aged 70-89 at baseline were included in the analyses. The association of lifestyle-related and dietary factors with development of categorically defined depression (> =48/80 on the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale) was assessed in a follow-up of 5 years.
Eleven percent (n=59) of the men developed depression during follow-up. An independent association with development of depression was found for baseline depressive status [Odds Ratio (OR) 1.19, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.10-1.28, p<0.001], a decline in serum total cholesterol level between study years (OR 1.76, 95%CI: 1.01-3.04, p=0.045), physical activity (OR 0.97, 95%CI: 0.94-1.00, p=0.022) and moderate alcohol intake (OR 0.35, 95%CI: 0.14-0.87, p=0.023) but not for dietary factors.
This study of a well-documented population of elderly European men confirms that physical activity and moderate alcohol consumption may protect against depression in the old-old.

17959552,Simon et al.,[Psychological factors considerably influence the results of 6-min walk test after coronary bypass surgery].,"The 6-min walk test (6MWT) is a simple, low-cost method for estimating physical exercise capacity of cardiac patients, when exercise test cannot be performed, as in patients early after coronary artery bypass surgery. As the test requests active cooperation of patients, possibly not only somatic, but psychological factors can influence the results. 358 patients who arrived to Phase II residential cardiac rehabilitation after their first coronary artery bypass surgery were included in the prospective study. 6-MWT was performed at the beginning and at the end of 3 weeks program. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Type-D personality test were filled in 3 weeks after surgery.
Patients characterized as Type-D personality (8.5%) covered considerably shorter distance than non-Type-D patients both at the beginning (255 +/- 91 m vs. 319 +/- 106 m, p < 0.01) and at the end of 6MWT (361 +/- 91 m vs. 411 +/- 106 m, p < 0.05) without any substantial differences in heart rate or rating of perceived exertion. Patients with high level of anxiety (16.5%) had lower walking distance compared to non anxious patients both at the beginning and the ending test (274 +/- 97 m vs. 320 +/- 106 m, p < 0.01 and 374 +/- 110 m vs. 413 +/- 104 m, p < 0.05), and evaluated higher rate of perceived exertion (12.5 +/- 1.1 vs. 11.9 +/- 1.4, p < 0.05 and 11.7 +/- 0.8 vs. 11.3 +/- 1.3, p < 0.05). Patients who were depressed according to HADS (14%) walked shorter distance than non depressed patients both at the beginning (267 +/- 88 m vs. 320 +/- 107 m, p < 0.01), and end of 6MWT (347 +/- 99 m vs. 416 +/- 104 m, p < 0.001).

17909394,Kamphuis et al.,"Physical inactivity, depression, and risk of cardiovascular mortality.","Studies indicate that depression may increase risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in addition to classical risk factors. One of the hypotheses to explain this relation is that depressed subjects become physically inactive. We set out to determine the role of physical inactivity in the relation between depressive symptoms and cardiovascular mortality.
Data were used from the population-based prospective Finland, Italy, and the Netherlands Elderly (FINE) Study. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale in 909 elderly men, aged 70-90 yr, free of CVD and diabetes at baseline in 1990. Physical activity was assessed with a questionnaire for retired men. Hazard ratios (HR) for 10-yr cardiovascular mortality were calculated, adjusting for demographics and cardiovascular risk factors.
At baseline, men with more depressive symptoms were less physically active (722 min.wk; 95% confidence interval (CI), 642-802) than men with few depressive symptoms (919 min.wk; 95% CI, 823-1015). During 10 yr of follow-up, 256 (28%) men died from CVD. The adjusted HR of cardiovascular mortality for a decrease of 30 min.d in physical activity was 1.09 (95% CI, 1.04-1.14). An increase in depressive symptoms with one standard deviation was associated with a higher cardiovascular mortality risk (HR = 1.42; 95% CI, 1.26-1.60). After additional adjustment for physical activity the risk decreased (9%), but an independent risk remained (HR = 1.37; 95% CI, 1.21-1.56). The excess risk on cardiovascular mortality attributable to the combined effect of depressive symptoms with inactivity was 1.47 (95% CI, -0.17 to 3.11).
In the present study, the increased risk of depressive symptoms on cardiovascular mortality could not be explained by physical inactivity. However, our results suggest that depressive symptoms and physical inactivity may interact to increase cardiovascular mortality risk.",[],Medicine and science in sports and exercise,10.1249/mss.0b013e3180f6109f,2007-10-03,"[{'lastname': 'Kamphuis', 'firstname': 'Marjolein H', 'initials': 'MH', 'affiliation': 'Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands. m.kamphuis@umcutrecht.nl'}, {'lastname': 'Geerlings', 'firstname': 'Mirjam I', 'initials': 'MI', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tijhuis', 'firstname': 'Marja A R', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Giampaoli', 'firstname': 'Simona', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Nissinen', 'firstname': 'Aulikki', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Grobbee', 'firstname': 'Diederick E', 'initials': 'DE', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kromhout', 'firstname': 'Daan', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}]",17909394,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,DENIED: wolterskluwer did not provide PDF link for this article

17621384,"Lee, Park",Does physical activity moderate the association between depressive symptoms and disability in older adults?,"Depressive symptoms and disability are closely associated and known to have reciprocal relationships. This study examines whether physical activity moderates the association between depressive symptoms and disability in community-dwelling older adults.
Baseline and 1-year follow-up data of 645 persons aged 65 years or older from the Suwon Longitudinal Aging Study were analyzed. A 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale, Physical Functioning scale, and physical performance tests were used to assess the individual's depressive symptoms and functional disability. Physical activity was defined as the recommended level of exercise based on its frequency and intensity. Multiple regression analysis with generalized estimating equations was conducted to examine the physical activity's role as an effect modifier in the association between depressive symptoms and disability.
Physical activity was a significant effect modifier in the 'depressive symptoms-disability' association, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and health-related covariates. Moderate-intensity activity was as effective as vigorous activity in moderating the relationship. The moderating effect was notable among those displaying severe depressive symptoms and functional disability. Over time the strength of the association between depressive symptoms and disability tended to diminish for those engaging in physical activity.
The association between depressive symptoms and disability is moderated by physical activity in older persons. The findings suggest that healthcare professionals need to promote moderate amount of physical activity as a potential intervention tool in attenuating the depression-disability connection in later life, especially among those with high levels of physical and mental impairments.",[],International journal of geriatric psychiatry,10.1002/gps.1870,2007-07-11,"[{'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Yunhwan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health, Ajou University School of Medicine, Youngtong-Gu, Suwon, Republic of Korea. yhlee@ajou.ac.kr'}, {'lastname': 'Park', 'firstname': 'Kyunghye', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}]",17621384,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,DENIED: Wiley E Publisher says no to https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gps.1870/pdf
17545451,Penninx et al.,Late-life depressive symptoms are associated with both hyperactivity and hypoactivity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis.,"Although depression has been associated with hyperactivity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, recent studies among depressed elderly have found decreased cortisol levels, which may be due to underlying physical frailty associated with HPA-axis hypoactivity. The authors examined the relationship between urinary cortisol level and late-life depressive symptoms. The authors also explored whether hypo- and hypercortisolemic depressive symptoms are qualitatively different.
Data are from 881 community-dwelling participants, average age 74.2 years, of the Aging in the Chianti Area Study. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) scale and cortisol levels were determined in 24-hour urine samples.
Mean urinary cortisol level was 98.9 microg/24 hours (SD=47.8), and 31% of the sample had significant depressive symptoms (CES-D > or =16). There was no linear association between urinary cortisol level and depressive symptoms; however, there was a nonlinear association between urinary cortisol level and depressive symptoms. Older persons in the lowest and highest urinary cortisol deciles were 2.2 and 1.9 times more likely to have significant depressive symptoms than older persons in all other deciles. Depressed persons with low cortisol presented more physical frailty than depressed persons with high cortisol.
Late-life depressive symptoms are associated with both hyperactivity and hypoactivity of the HPA axis, which suggests distinct mechanisms for these associations.",[],The American journal of geriatric psychiatry : official journal of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry,10.1097/JGP.0b013e318033ed80,2007-06-05,"[{'lastname': 'Penninx', 'firstname': 'Brenda W J H', 'initials': 'BW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and EMGO Institute, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. b.penninx@vumc.nl'}, {'lastname': 'Beekman', 'firstname': 'Aartjan T F', 'initials': 'AT', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bandinelli', 'firstname': 'Stephania', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Corsi', 'firstname': 'Anna Maria', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bremmer', 'firstname': 'Marijke', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hoogendijk', 'firstname': 'Witte J', 'initials': 'WJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Guralnik', 'firstname': 'Jack M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ferrucci', 'firstname': 'Luigi', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}]","17545451

King County, Washington.
Seven hundred forty randomly selected men and women aged 65 and older, cognitively intact, living in the same home for at least 2 years.
Depressive symptoms were measured with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. The Walkable and Bikable Communities Project provided objective data predicting the probability of walking at least 150 minutes per week in a particular neighborhood. ACT data were linked at the individual level via a geographic information system to this walkability score using buffer radii of 100, 500, and 1,000 meters around the subject's home. Multiple regression analysis tests were conducted for associations between the buffer-specific neighborhood walkability score and depressive symptoms.
There was a significant association between neighborhood walkability and depressive symptoms in men when adjusted for individual-level factors of income, physical activity, education, smoking status, living alone, age, ethnicity, and chronic disease. The odds ratio for the interquartile range (25th to 75th percentile) of walkability score was 0.31 to 0.33 for the buffer radii (P=.02), indicating a protective association with neighborhood walkability. This association was not significant in women.

In an older population, this relationship should be examined in a wider concept of multiple factors potentially able to influence infection rate and reported symptomatology. Especially, the impact of depression should be taken into consideration.
To examine the association of URTI with PA and depressive symptoms in the elderly, and whether this relationship persists after controlling for confounders attributable to comorbidities, functional status, and cognitive function.
One hundred and forty-five subjects (80 women and 65 men) between 66 and 79 years of age were randomly chosen from all inhabitants of one district of the city of Lodz (Poland). They participated in baseline and 1-year follow-up examinations and completed the infection questionnaire during the whole year. Log books for daily recording of the URTI symptomatology were used in the prospective design. The PA was assessed by the Seven-Day Physical Activity Recall Questionnaire. Geriatric Depression Scale and other elements of the comprehensive geriatric assessment were also used.
In bivariate relationships, the number of episodes per year and the number of days with URTI per year were significantly negatively associated with several baseline and follow-up PA indices and directly related to baseline and follow-up depression scores. In multivariate relationships, after controlling for other elements of the comprehensive geriatric assessment, both PA and depression contributed to URTI symptomatology, while URTI symptoms predicted final PA scores, and changes in PA added to the follow-up depression score.
These results indicate that in elderly subjects the symptomatology of URTI is interrelated with their habitual PA and depressive symptomatology. Less active and more depressed subjects develop more URTI symptoms during 1-year follow-up. This URTI symptomatology, together with the baseline PA and the depressive status, contributes to the follow-up PA and depression scores.",[],Gerontology,10.1159/000100017,2007-02-23,"[{'lastname': 'Kostka', 'firstname': 'Tomasz', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Geriatrics, Medical University of Lodz, WHO Collaborating Centre for Noncommunicable Diseases Prevention and Control, Lodz, Poland.

16046375,Everson-Rose et al.,"Do depressive symptoms predict declines in physical performance in an elderly, biracial population?","We investigated whether depressive symptoms, assessed by the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), predicted change in physical function in elderly adults.
Participants were from a biracial, population-based sample of adults aged 65 and older (N: 4069; 61% black; 61% female). Physical function was assessed as a summary performance measure of tandem stand, measured walk, and repeated chair stand (mean [standard deviation], 10.3 [3.5]; range, 0-15), commonly used measures of overall physical health in older adults. Generalized estimating equation models estimated physical function across 3 assessments over 5.4 years of follow up as a function of CES-D scores at baseline.
Adjusting for age, sex, race, and education, each 1-point higher CES-D score was associated with a 0.34-point lower absolute level of physical performance (p < .0001), but there was no evidence of a CES-D by time interaction (p = .84), indicating that depressive symptoms at baseline were not associated with greater physical performance decline over time. In secondary analyses, with CES-D scores modeled in 4 categories, overall physical performance showed a graded, inverse association across CES-D categories (p's < .0001). However, we observed no threshold effect for depressive symptoms in relation to change in physical performance. Compared with the referent group (CES-D = 0), the 2 middle CES-D categories (CES-D = 1 or 2-3) evidenced some decline in physical performance over time, but the highest CES-D group (CES-D > or =4) showed no significant physical decline over time (p = .89).
We observed a strong cross-sectional association between depressive symptoms and overall physical performance. Physical function declined over time, yet depressive symptoms did not consistently contribute to greater decline over an average of 5.4 years of follow up among older adults. Findings highlight the importance of longitudinal models in understanding the relation between depressive symptomatology and physical health.",[],Psychosomatic medicine,10.1097/01.psy.0000170334.77508.35,2005-07-28,"[{'lastname': 'Everson-Rose', 'firstname': 'Susan A', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': 'Rush Institute for Healthy Aging, Rush University Medical Center, Department of Preventive Medicine, Chicago, Illinois 60612, USA.

15935024,Leinonen et al.,Genetic influences underlying self-rated health in older female twins.,"To examine the genetic and environmental sources of variation in self-rated health (SRH) in older female twins and to explore the roles of morbidity, functional limitation, and psychological well-being as mediators of genetic and environmental effects on SRH.
Cross-sectional analysis of twin data.
Research laboratory.
One hundred two monozygotic and 115 dizygotic female twin pairs aged 63 to 76.
SRH was categorized as good, average, or poor. Morbidity was described using a physician-assessed disease-severity scale together with information about the presence of diabetes mellitus and cancer. Maximal walking speed measured over 10 m was used to assess physical functional limitation; the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale were used to characterize psychological well-being. The contributions of genetic and environmental (defined as familial (shared by siblings) or nonshared (unique to each sibling)) effects were assessed using univariate and multivariate structural equation modeling of twin data.
SRH did not have its own specific genetic effect but shared a genetic component in common with the genetic components underlying liability to disease severity, maximal walking speed, and depressive symptoms. It accounted for 64% of the variation in SRH, with environmental effects accounting for the remaining variation.
The current results suggest that there are no specific genetic effects on SRH but rather that genetic influences on SRH are mediated through genetic influences affecting chronic diseases, functional limitation, and mood.",[],Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,10.1111/j.1532-5415.2005.53319.x,2005-06-07,"[{'lastname': 'Leinonen', 'firstname': 'Raija', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Finnish Center for Interdisciplinary Gerontology, Department of Health Sciences, University of Jyväskylaä, Finland. raija.leinonen@sport.jyu.fi'}, {'lastname': 'Kaprio', 'firstname': 'Jaakko', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Jylhä', 'firstname': 'Marja', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tolvanen', 'firstname': 'Asko', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Koskenvuo', 'firstname': 'Markku', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Heikkinen', 'firstname': 'Eino', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rantanen', 'firstname': 'Taina', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}]",15935024,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,DENIED: Wiley E Publisher says no to https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1532-5415.2005.53319.x/pdf

Repeated-measures study.
Participants' homes.
Twenty subjects with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and a control group of 10 age-, sex-, and education-matched subjects.
Subjects performed a simple functional task that included a walking component and a dual-motor task. The functional task was performed with and without external rhythmic (auditory and visual) cues.
Walking speed, mean step length, and step frequency were compared during trials of the tasks. In addition, tests of cognitive executive function (Hayling and Brixton tests), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory) were undertaken.
The use of auditory cues during a dual task involving gait reduced the interference effect on the task; significant increases in step length were observed in PD subjects ( P =.018), representing an increase of 19%.
External auditory cues may be useful in reducing interference and maintaining gait performance during more complicated functional activities. Clinical symptoms, such as depression and fatigue, could influence the ability to focus attention and may increase gait interference during the performance of complex tasks, with subsequent implications for functional walking and safety.",[],Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,10.1016/j.apmr.2004.10.040,2005-05-17,"[{'lastname': 'Rochester', 'firstname': 'Lynn', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Northumbria University, Newcastle, UK.

15756585,Thorsen et al.,The association between self-reported physical activity and prevalence of depression and anxiety disorder in long-term survivors of testicular cancer and men in a general population sample.,"Physical activity is claimed to have a beneficial influence on a person's mental health, though its impact may be different in cancer patients and individuals in the general population. The objective of this cross-sectional study was (1) to estimate the associations between the level of self-reported physical activity as a lifestyle factor (LPA) and the prevalence of depression and anxiety disorder in testicular cancer survivors (TCSs) and in men of similar age from the general population (GenPop), and (2) to examine whether these associations differ in the two groups.
A total of 1260 TCSs and 20,207 men from the GenPop completed a questionnaire that assessed LPA, and depression and anxiety disorder on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).
The prevalence of HADS-defined depression was lower among those who were physically active than in those who were physically inactive (TCSs 9% vs 17%, P<0.001; GenPop 8% vs 15%, P<0.001). Among physically inactive TCSs there was a trend towards higher a prevalence of HADS-defined anxiety disorder compared to physically active TCSs (P=0.07). In the GenPop this difference was statistically significant (P<0.001). Multivariate analysis confirmed the association between LPA and HADS-defined depression in both the TCSs [adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=0.56; 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.31, 1.02)] and the GenPop [aOR=0.58; 95% CI (0.51, 0.65)], but not the association between LPA and HADS-defined anxiety disorder. The associations between LPA and HADS-defined depression and HADS-defined anxiety disorder did not differ between the TCSs and the GenPop.
In both the TCSs and the GenPop, the prevalence of HADS-defined depression was higher among those who were physically inactive than among those who were physically active, with no intergroup difference. There was no association between LPA and prevalence of HADS-defined anxiety disorder in either of the groups after adjusting for background variables.

We examined the association of anxiety and depression with healthy behaviors in a large population of subjects at risk of cardiovascular disease. We studied 1612 consecutive subjects referred for evaluation of cardiovascular risk factors. Separated scores reflecting unhealthy behaviors (physical inactivity, smoking and poor diet) were combined to produce a global unhealthy lifestyle score. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD) was used to assess both anxiety and depression. Both anxiety and depression were significantly associated with physical inactivity in both sexes and with an unhealthy diet in men but not in women. Anxiety and depression were both significantly correlated to smoking habits in men whereas only depression was related to smoking in women. In both sexes, the global score reflecting unhealthy lifestyles was positively associated with the degree of anxiety and depression. In multivariate analysis, both anxiety and depression appeared as independent determinant of unhealthy lifestyle in both sexes, with a stronger influence for depression. Depression and to a lesser extent anxiety are associated with a cluster of unhealthy behaviors in subjects at risk of cardiovascular disease, suggesting the difficulty of modifying lifestyle in patients with anxious-depressive disorders.",[],Atherosclerosis,10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2004.08.035,2005-02-08,"[{'lastname': 'Bonnet', 'firstname': 'Fabrice', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Unit 11, Cardiovascular Hospital Louis Pradel, 69394 Lyon, France. fab.so.bonnet@free.fr'}, {'lastname': 'Irving', 'firstname': 'Kate', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Terra', 'firstname': 'Jean-Louis', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Nony', 'firstname': 'Patrice', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Berthezène', 'firstname': 'François', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Moulin', 'firstname': 'Philippe', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}]",15694943,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,DENIED: ScienceDirect did not provide pdf link (probably paywalled)

Depression was measured at baseline with a short form of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. Risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events were estimated from Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for multiple demographic, clinical, and risk factor covariates.
Current depressive symptoms above the screening cutoff point were reported by 15.8% of women. Depression was significantly related to CVD risk and comorbidity (odds ratios ranging from 1.12 for hypertension to 1.60 for history of stroke or angina). Among women with no history of CVD, depression was an independent predictor of CVD death (relative risk, 1.50) and all-cause mortality (relative risk, 1.32) after adjustment for age, race, education, income, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, high cholesterol level requiring medication, body mass index, and physical activity. Taking antidepressant medications did not alter the depression-associated risks associated.
A large proportion of older women report levels of depressive symptoms that are significantly related to increased risk of CVD death and all-cause mortality, even after controlling for established CVD risk factors.

At baseline, 80% (N = 1224) and after the 8-year follow-up period (1996) 88% (N = 663) of eligible persons were interviewed. All non-institutionalized men and women (N = 384) who participated in both baseline and follow-up interviews, who supplied data on the main questions of interest and who had no depressive symptoms at baseline, were selected for analysis. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Finnish modified version of Beck's 13-item depression scale (RBDI). Physical activity was assessed on a seven-point scale. Mobility status was defined as the ability to walk two kilometers and climb one flight of stairs.
Subjects who were mobility-disabled and had a sedentary life-style had a higher risk (OR = 2.44) for depressive symptoms at follow-up than those who had good mobility and were physically active. The risk was also higher (OR = 1.99) in those who were mobility-disabled and had a physically active life-style, compared with physically active individuals with intact mobility. Those with good mobility had fewer depressive symptoms than those who had mobility problems, irrespective of the level of physical activity. No significant interaction was observed between physical activity and mobility in predicting the development of depressive symptoms. Older age significantly increased, and the number of chronic illnesses tended to increase the risk of developing depressive symptoms during the follow-up period. Gender and length of education were not significant predictors of depressive symptoms.
Mobility problems and older age seem to increase the risk for developing depressive symptoms in elderly people.

In this work, we evaluated the association between coffee consumption and the risk of developing acute coronary syndromes, based on a random sample of 848 patients with their first coronary heart disease event and 1078 frequency-matched controls with no cardiovascular disease in their medical history, from the entire country. The multivariate analysis raises a J-shaped association between the risk of developing acute coronary syndromes and the quantity of coffee consumed per day. In particular, the odds ratios for moderate (<300 mL/d), heavy (300-600 mL/d), and very heavy (>600 mL/d), consumption, relative to no consumption, were 0.69 (95% CI, 0.50-0.86), 1.56 (95% CI, 1.10-2.34) and 3.10 (95% CI, 1.82-5.26), respectively, after controlling for the presence of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, family history of premature coronary heart disease, physical activity status, smoking habits, BMI, alcohol consumption, triglycerides, consumption of several food items, depression scale score and education status.

12823653,McDermott et al.,Depressive symptoms and lower extremity functioning in men and women with peripheral arterial disease.,"Factors associated with impaired functioning in patients with lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) are not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between depressive symptoms and objective measures of lower extremity functioning in persons with PAD.
Cross-sectional.
Four hundred twenty-three men and women with PAD identified from 3 Chicago area medical centers.
PAD was defined as ankle brachial index (ABI) <0.90. The Geriatric Depression Scale short form (GDS-S) (0-15 scale, 15 = worst) was completed by all participants. A clinically significant number of depressive symptoms was defined as a GDS-S score >or=6. Six-minute walk distance and usual-and fast-pace walking velocity were determined for all participants. A GDS-S score >or=6 was present in 21.7% of participants with PAD. Adjusting for age, increasing numbers of depressive symptoms were associated with an increasing prevalence of leg pain on exertion and rest (P =.004). Adjusting for age, sex, race, ABI, number of comorbidities, current smoking, and antidepressant medications, increasing numbers of depressive symptoms were associated with shorter 6-minute walk distance (P <.001), slower usual-pace walking velocity (P =.005), and slower fast-pace walking velocity (P =.005). These relationships were attenuated slightly after additional adjustment for presence versus absence of leg pain on exertion and rest and severity of exertional leg symptoms.
Among men and women with PAD, the prevalence of a clinically significant number of depressive symptoms is high. Greater numbers of depressive symptoms are associated with greater impairment in lower extremity functioning. Further study is needed to determine whether identifying and treating depressive symptoms in PAD is associated with improved lower extremity functioning.",[],Journal of general internal medicine,10.1046/j.1525-1497.2003.20527.x,2003-06-26,"[{'lastname': 'McDermott', 'firstname': 'Mary McGrae', 'initials': 'MM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, USA. mdm608@northwestern.edu'}, {'lastname': 'Greenland', 'firstname': 'Philip', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Guralnik', 'firstname': 'Jack M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Kiang', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Criqui', 'firstname': 'Michael H', 'initials': 'MH', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Pearce', 'firstname': 'William H', 'initials': 'WH', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Chan', 'firstname': 'Cheeling', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Schneider', 'firstname': 'Joseph', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sharma', 'firstname': 'Leena', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Taylor', 'firstname': 'Lloyd M', 'initials': 'LM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Arseven', 'firstname': 'Adnan', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Quann', 'firstname': 'Maureen', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Celic', 'firstname': 'Lillian', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}]","12823653

Cross-sectional study.
Retirement villages.
A total of 515 people between the ages of 62 and 95 years (mean +/- standard deviation, 79.5+/-6.4y) residing in retirement villages in Australia.
Not applicable.
Quantitative tests of vision, strength, peripheral sensation, reaction time, and balance and short Mini-Mental State Examination, Geriatric Depression Scale, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), and 6MWD.
All physiologic, psychologic, and health scores were significantly associated with 6MWD. Multiple regression analysis revealed that 10 factors (visual contrast sensitivity, lower-limb strength, simple reaction time, postural sway, maximal balance range, PANAS positive scale score, SF-36 pain score, number of medications used, SF-36 general health subscale score, age) were significant and independent predictors of 6MWD performance. Of these measures, strength, maximal balance range, medication use, and age explained the largest proportions of the variance in 6MWD. The final regression model explained over half (52.5%) of the variance in 6MWD (multiple r=.72).
In older people, 6MWD depends on multiple physiologic, psychologic, and health factors.

11958388,Arseven et al.,Peripheral arterial disease and depressed mood in older men and women.,"The objective of this study was to determine whether lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is associated with depressive symptoms and whether PAD-related disability mediates the association between PAD and depressive symptoms. The study used a cross-sectional design set in an academic medical center. A cohort of men and women aged 55 years and older with (n = 93) or without (n = 74) PAD was recruited. PAD subjects were identified from a blood flow laboratory and a general medicine practice. Non-PAD subjects were identified from the same general medicine practice. PAD was diagnosed and quantified using the ankle-brachial index (ABI). Depressive symptoms were assessed by the 15-item short version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-S; score range 0-15, 0 = no depressive symptoms). The six-minute walk test and the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) distance score (score range 0-100, 100 = better walking ability) were measures of walking impairment. PAD subjects had depressive mood (DM) (defined by GDS-S score >5) twice as often as controls (24% vs 12%, p = 0.06). After adjustment for age, education, and number of comorbidities, the prevalence of depressive mood among PAD subjects was increased, but this association was not significant (OR = 1.8, 95% CI 0.7-4.4). The WIQ distance score weakened the association between PAD and DM, and higher distance scores were associated with a lower likelihood of DM (OR = 0.98 per one unit of the WIQ, 95% CI 0.96-0.99). Among PAD subjects, severe PAD (ABI <0.5) was not significantly associated with DM (OR = 1.4, 95% CI 0.5-4.1), but a greater 6-min walk distance was associated with a lower likelihood of DM (OR = 0.8 per 100 feet, 95% CI 0.70-0.97). Substituting the WIQ scores for six-min walk distance in the model showed that higher WIQ scores were associated with lower likelihood of DM among PAD subjects (OR= 0.98 per one unit of the WIQ, 95% CI 0.95-1.0), though the association did not achieve statistical significance. In conclusion, these data suggest that PAD may be associated with an increased risk of DM and that this relationship may be related to PAD-associated disability. An evaluation for depression may be appropriate in men and women with PAD.

Pre- and post-intervention assessment utilized live measures of mood: Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression Scale, Profile of Mood States, Depression-Happiness Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and the General Well-Being Schedule. Analysis of covariance indicated that the intervention was effective in improving women's overall mood, self-esteem, and general sense of well-being and in decreasing symptoms on two measures of depression. Of particular note, the data from all five outcome measures supported the efficacy of the intervention. In addition, a high level of adherence to the intervention protocol was observed with two-thirds of the women reporting 100% adherence.

Although unsupervised exercise has been shown to benefit younger depressed patients, there is no evidence that unsupervised exercise can be used as a maintenance treatment for depression in elderly patients. Our aim was to test the feasibility and efficacy of unsupervised exercise as a long-term treatment for clinical depression in elderly patients.
We studied 32 subjects (71.3 +/- 1.2 years of age, mean +/- SE) in a 20-week, randomized, controlled trial, with follow-up at 26 months.

No contact was made with either group after 20 weeks until final follow-up. Blinded assessment was made with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Philadelphia Geriatric Morale Scale, and Ewart's Self Efficacy Scale at 20 weeks and with the BDI and physical activity questionnaire at 26 months.
Patients randomized to the exercise condition completed 18 +/- 2 sessions of unsupervised exercise during Weeks 10 to 20.

Population-based, cross-sectional study.
Study subjects were participants in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), a longitudinal, long-term, follow-up study, at the University of California Davis (Sacramento, California) and the University of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) clinical centers.
A random sample of 1,566 Medicare enrollees age 65 and older enrolled in the CHS.
Total hip BMD, measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), after adjustment for multiple covariates, was compared with depression evaluated with the Center for Epidemiological Studies 10-item Depression Scale (CES-Dm). Risk factors for osteoporosis were compared in depressed and nondepressed participants. Potential correlates were entered into a regression model. Depression scores were compared in normal, osteopenic, and osteoporotic individuals.
Sixteen percent of participants were clinically depressed; 9% had BMDs in the osteoporotic range. Mean BMD was 40 mg/cm2 lower in those with clinical depression. High CES-Dm scores were associated with lower BMD (P < .001) when adjusted for body mass index (BMI), age, kilocalories of activity, estrogen use, gender, race, smoking and drinking. When stratified by race, this remained true for all Caucasians (P < .01), all African Americans (P < .05), and when stratified by race and gender the association remained only for all Caucasian women (P < .001). In women and Caucasian men there was an increase in depression scores among individuals with osteoporotic-range BMDs.
A significant association was found between BMD and depressive symptoms after adjustment for osteoporosis risk factors. In Caucasians, depressive symptoms were associated with both osteoporotic and osteopenic levels of BMD. Causality cannot be ascribed, with only one measurement of BMD. We postulate that there may be an unmeasured third factor, such as an endogenous steroid, that is responsible for both low BMD and depression.",[],Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,10.1046/j.1532-5415.2001.49149.x,2001-07-17,"[{'lastname': 'Robbins', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of California Davis, Sacramento, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hirsch', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Whitmer', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Cauley', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Harris', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}]",11454111,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,DENIED: Wiley E Publisher says no to https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1532-5415.2001.49149.x/pdf

10845746,"Lampinen, Heikkinen, Ruoppila",Changes in intensity of physical exercise as predictors of depressive symptoms among older adults: an eight-year follow-up.,"Epidemiological research suggests that regular physical activity may be associated with reduced depressive symptoms. The present study examines the predictive value of physical exercise in relation to depressive symptoms among samples of adults aged 65+ during an 8-year period.
The subjects (N = 663) who participated both at the baseline (1988) and the follow-up (1996) interviews were selected for the analyses. The dependent variable depressive symptoms was assessed by the Finnish modified version of Beck's 13-item depression scale. The independent variable was the intensity of physical exercise.
The intensity of physical exercise decreased among the older men and women. Those who had reduced their intensity of physical exercise during the 8 years reported more depressive symptoms at the follow-up than those who had remained active or increased their physical activity. Depressive symptoms were predicted by the intensity of baseline physical exercise, earlier depressive symptoms, older age, gender, having three or more chronic somatic conditions, and difficulties in performing ADL activities.
Age-related decrease in the intensity of physical exercise increases the risk of depressive symptoms among older adults.

10547175,Blumenthal et al.,Effects of exercise training on older patients with major depression.,"Previous observational and interventional studies have suggested that regular physical exercise may be associated with reduced symptoms of depression. However, the extent to which exercise training may reduce depressive symptoms in older patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) has not been systematically evaluated.
To assess the effectiveness of an aerobic exercise program compared with standard medication (ie, antidepressants) for treatment of MDD in older patients, we conducted a 16-week randomized controlled trial.
One hundred fifty-six men and women with MDD (age, > or = 50 years) were assigned randomly to a program of aerobic exercise, antidepressants (sertraline hydrochloride), or combined exercise and medication. Subjects underwent comprehensive evaluations of depression, including the presence and severity of MDD using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores before and after treatment. Secondary outcome measures included aerobic capacity, life satisfaction, self-esteem, anxiety, and dysfunctional cognitions.
After 16 weeks of treatment, the groups did not differ statistically on HAM-D or BDI scores (P = .67); adjustment for baseline levels of depression yielded an essentially identical result. Growth curve models revealed that all groups exhibited statistically and clinically significant reductions on HAM-D and BDI scores. However, patients receiving medication alone exhibited the fastest initial response; among patients receiving combination therapy, those with less severe depressive symptoms initially showed a more rapid response than those with initially more severe depressive symptoms.
An exercise training program may be considered an alternative to antidepressants for treatment of depression in older persons. Although antidepressants may facilitate a more rapid initial therapeutic response than exercise, after 16 weeks of treatment exercise was equally effective in reducing depression among patients with MDD.",[],Archives of internal medicine,10.1001/archinte.159.19.2349,1999-11-05,"[{'lastname': 'Blumenthal', 'firstname': 'J A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA. blume003@mc.duke.edu'}, {'lastname': 'Babyak', 'firstname': 'M A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Moore', 'firstname': 'K A', 'initials': 'KA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Craighead', 'firstname': 'W E', 'initials': 'WE', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Herman', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Khatri', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Waugh', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Napolitano', 'firstname': 'M A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Forman', 'firstname': 'L M', 'initials': 'LM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Appelbaum', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Doraiswamy', 'firstname': 'P M', 'initials': 'PM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Krishnan', 'firstname': 'K R', 'initials': 'KR', 'affiliation': None}]",10547175,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Arch Intern Med"""
10474551,Penninx et al.,Exploring the effect of depression on physical disability: longitudinal evidence from the established populations for epidemiologic studies of the elderly.,"This study examined the effect of depression on the incidence of physical disability and the role of confounding and explanatory variables in this relationship.
A cohort of 6247 subjects 65 years and older who were initially free of disability was followed up for 6 years. Baseline depression was assessed by the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. Disability in mobility and disability in activities of daily living were measured annually.
Compared with the 5751 nondepressed subjects, the 496 depressed subjects had a relative risk (95% confidence interval) of 1.67 (1.44, 1.95) and 1.73 (1.54, 1.94) for incident disability in activities of daily living and mobility, respectively. Adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics and baseline chronic conditions reduced the risks to 1.39 (1.18, 1.63) and 1.45 (1.29, 1.93), respectively. Less physical activity and fewer social contacts among depressed persons further explained part of their increased disability risk.
Depression in older persons may increase the risk for incident disability. This excess risk is partly explained by depressed persons' decreased physical activity and social interaction.

9460778,Segar et al.,The effect of aerobic exercise on self-esteem and depressive and anxiety symptoms among breast cancer survivors.,"To evaluate the effects of 10 weeks of aerobic exercise on depressive and anxiety symptoms and self-esteem of breast cancer survivors.
Experimental, crossover.
Midwestern university town.
Twenty-four breast cancer survivors (mean time following surgery 41.8 months; ranging from 1 to 99 months) recruited via mail and cancer support groups. The mean age of the sample was 48.9 years.
Subjects were assigned randomly into exercise (EX), exercise-plus-behavior modification (EX + BM), and control groups. EX and EX + BM groups exercised aerobically four days/week at > or = 60% of age-predicted maximum heart rate for 10 weeks. Data were collected pretest, post-test, and crossover (12 weeks following post-test). Because pretest or post-test scores showed no statistical differences between EX and EX + BM groups, data were combined to form one group.
Aerobic exercise (four days/ week; 30-40 minutes/session), depression, (Beck Depression inventory), anxiety (Speilberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), and self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Inventory).
Pre- to post-test analyses revealed that women who exercised had significantly less depression and state and trait anxiety over time compared to controls. After the crossover, the control group demonstrated comparable improvements in both depressive and state anxiety scores. Self-esteem did not change significantly. Subjects who received exercise recommendations from their physicians exercised significantly more than subjects who received no recommendation.
Mild to moderate aerobic exercise may be of therapeutic value to breast cancer survivors with respect to depressive and anxiety symptoms but not to self-esteem. A physician's recommendation to exercise appears to be an important factor in a patient's exercise adherence.
To Improve depressive and anxiety symptoms following breast cancer surgery, healthcare professionals should consider recommending mild to moderate exercise.",[],Oncology nursing forum,,1998-02-14,"[{'lastname': 'Segar', 'firstname': 'M L', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': 'Division of Kinesiology, School of Public Health, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Katch', 'firstname': 'V L', 'initials': 'VL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Roth', 'firstname': 'R S', 'initials': 'RS', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Garcia', 'firstname': 'A W', 'initials': 'AW', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Portner', 'firstname': 'T I', 'initials': 'TI', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Glickman', 'firstname': 'S G', 'initials': 'SG', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Haslanger', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wilkins', 'firstname': 'E G', 'initials': 'EG', 'affiliation': None}]",9460778,debd9b3c-4531-462c-b2c2-983b2710fe81,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Oncol Nurs Forum"""

Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Hamilton Rating Scale of Depression (HRSD), and the Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form 36 (SF-36). Results showed that exercise significantly improved all subjective sleep-quality and depression measures. Depression measures were reduced by approximately twice that of controls. Habitual activity was not significantly increased by exercise. Quality of life subscales significantly improved. In a forward stepwise multiple regression, percent improvement in GDS and percent increase in strength remained significant predictors of the improvement in total PSQI score (r = 0.71, p = 0.0002).

7874595,Helmes et al.,A questionnaire to evaluate disability in osteoporotic patients with vertebral compression fractures.,"Few studies have reported on the functional disability due to vertebral compression factors in osteoporosis. The Osteoporosis Functional Disability Questionnaire (OFDQ) was developed to assess disability in patients with osteoporosis and back pain due to vertebral fractures. The domains of the OFDQ include: quantitative indices of pain, a standard 20-item depression scale, 26 items relating to functional abilities, a scale of social activities, and confidence in the ability of prescribed osteoporosis treatment to reverse disability.
Reliability of the OFDQ was assessed using test-retest and internal consistency methods. Criterion validity was demonstrated by correlating disability against radiographic evidence of vertebral fractures. Construct validity was demonstrated through comparisons of 81 patients with osteoporosis and fractures to 37 healthy age-matched controls. Additional evidence was found in comparing 45 of the 81 cases who were actively engaged in an exercise program with 36 cases who were sedentary.
The test-retest reliabilities ranged from .76 to .93, with internal consistencies from .57 to .96. The OFDQ correlated significantly with relevant spinal pathology, and showed significant improvements in activities of daily living and socialization when active exercisers were compared to inactive patients with osteoporosis.
The OFDQ is a reliable instrument which correlates well with objective measures of osteoporotic spinal damage. It is also sensitive to changes in disability brought about by participation in our aerobic exercise program. The OFDQ may be a useful adjunct to measuring outcomes in other osteoporotic treatment protocols.",[],"The journals of gerontology.

The influences of sociodemographic covariates on this relationship; and 3. The effects of functional impairment or inactivity level in mediating the relationship between angina and depressive symptoms. The data utilized for this study was from the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES) on 1,558 Mexican American women. The survey was cross sectional, conducted in 1982-84. The dependent variable was depression as measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Depression Scale (CES-D). The independent variable was the presence of angina as measured by the Rose Questionnaire. Covariates included functional impairment, physical activity, age, education, acculturation, poverty level, marital status, and work status. The findings suggest that functional impairment has a stronger association with depressive symptoms than angina or physical inactivity. Significant sociodemographic variables include single marital status and poverty.

This is a secondary analysis of a randomized, quadruple-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial from February 1, 2018, to May 31, 2021, including 350 children receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics in the inpatient and outpatient settings. Patients were followed up until 1 month after the intervention period. Fecal samples and data were analyzed between September 1, 2022, and February 28, 2023. Eligibility criteria included 3 months to 18 years of age and recruitment within 24 hours following initiation of broad-spectrum systemic antibiotics. In total, 646 eligible patients were approached and 350 participated in the trial.
Participants were randomly assigned to receive daily placebo or a multispecies probiotic formulation consisting of 8 strains from 5 different genera during antibiotic treatment and for 7 days afterward.
Fecal stool samples were collected at 4 predefined times: (1) inclusion, (2) last day of antibiotic use, (3) last day of the study intervention, and (4) 1 month after intervention. Microbiota analysis was performed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing.
A total of 350 children were randomized and collected stool samples from 88 were eligible for the microbiota analysis (54 boys and 34 girls; mean [SD] age, 47.09 [55.64] months). Alpha diversity did not significantly differ between groups at the first 3 times. Shannon diversity (mean [SD], 3.56 [0.75] vs 3.09 [1.00]; P = .02) and inverse Simpson diversity (mean [SD], 3.75 [95% CI, 1.66-5.82] vs -1.31 [95% CI, -3.17 to 0.53]; P = 1 × 10-4) indices were higher in the placebo group compared with the probiotic group 1 month after intervention. Beta diversity was not significantly different at any of the times. Three of 5 supplemented genera had higher relative abundance during probiotic supplementation, but this difference had disappeared after 1 month.
The studied probiotic mixture had minor and transient effects on the microbiota composition during and after antibiotic treatment. Further research is needed to understand their working mechanisms in manipulating the microbiome and preventing antibiotic-associated dysbiosis and adverse effects such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea.

38350485,Cuevas-Gómez et al.,Feed supplementation with Ligilactobacillus salivarius PS21603 optimises intestinal morphology and gut microbiota composition in weaned piglets.,"Post-weaning diarrhoea in piglets remains an important cause of economic losses for swine producers. Feed supplementation with probiotics is one of the alternatives to antibiotics used to reduce the impact of such gastrointestinal disease. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of Ligilactobacillus salivarius PS21603 supplementation on the intestinal structure and the gut microbiota composition of weaned piglets. Safety and tolerance of L. salivarius PS21603 were previously evaluated in a 28-days study using 384 weaned piglets (28 ± 2 days old and 7.5 ± 1.5 kg) divided in three treatment groups: T1: Basal diet + L. salivarius PS21603 109 cfu/day, T2: Basal diet + L. salivarius PS21603 107 cfu/day, and T3: Basal diet (control group). For the present study, 16 piglets per treatment group were randomly selected and faecal samples were collected on day 0 (weaning) and 28 of study. At the end of study, three males and three females per treatment were euthanised. Intestinal morphometric values were measured after necropsy. Faecal counts of Escherichia coli were evaluated by culture techniques, and faecal microbiota composition was assessed by high-throughput sequencing. All data were analysed and compared between treatment groups. Supplementation with L. salivarius PS21603 caused an increase in the intestine length of piglets from T1 and in the villous height:crypt ratio of piglets from T2 (P < 0.05) compared to T3 on day 28. According to the Shannon Diversity Index, microbiota diversity increased on day 28 compared to day 0, with no significant differences observed between treatments. The main changes in the relative abundance of bacteria at the phylum, family, and genus levels were observed between different sampling time points. However, piglets from T1 and T2 had lower faecal E. coli counts than T3 on day 28 (P < 0.05). Moreover, supplementation with L. salivarius PS21603 modulated gut microbiota through a more optimal composition, reducing Escherichia and increasing Bifidobacterium relative abundance in piglets from T1 (P < 0.05) from the beginning to the end of the study. Therefore, the strain L. salivarius PS21603 has shown probiotic properties to be used as feed additive in the pig industry, along with good hygiene and farm management practices, for the prevention and/or treatment of post-weaning diarrhoea in piglets.",[],Beneficial microbes,10.1163/18762891-bja00001,2024-02-14,"[{'lastname': 'Cuevas-Gómez', 'firstname': 'I', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Probisearch S.L.U., C/Santiago Grisolı́a, 2, 28760 Tres Cantos, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'de Andrés', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Probisearch S.L.U., C/Santiago Grisolı́a, 2, 28760 Tres Cantos, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Cardenas', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Probisearch S.L.U., C/Santiago Grisolı́a, 2, 28760 Tres Cantos, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Espinosa-Martos', 'firstname': 'I', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Probisearch S.L.U., C/Santiago Grisolı́a, 2, 28760 Tres Cantos, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Jiménez', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Probisearch S.L.U., C/Santiago Grisolı́a, 2, 28760 Tres Cantos, Spain.'}]",38350485,92c5771b-8f73-4790-8fb2-3f35f492d0fe,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Benef Microbes"""

A total of 76 pediatric patients with bronchopneumonia infection were included in the study. We divided the patients into observation group (n=38) and control group (n=38). The patients in control group received intravenous infusion of antibiotics and symptomatic treatments. In the observation group, in addition to the treatments of the control group, the patients also received oral probiotic. We compared the effective times of treatment, including the durations of wet rale in lung auscultation, cough, fever, and the total time of hospitalization. Additionally, we also recorded the occurrence of adverse reaction, including rash and gastrointestinal reaction. Meanwhile, laboratory tests for systemic inflammation were recorded at different time points.
The durations of rale in lung auscultation (p=0.006), cough (p=0.019), fever (p=0.012), and the total time of hospitalization (p=0.046) in observation group were significantly shorter than those in the control group. The incidence rate of diarrhea was 10.5% (4/38) in the observation group, and 34.2% (13/38) in the control group, with a significantly statistical difference (p=0.013). In the laboratory tests, we found that blood lymphocyte (p=0.034) and high-sensitive C reactive protein (p=0.004) were significantly higher in the control group than that in the observation group at 7th day after the treatments.

36930725,Tong et al.,"Dietary supplementation with probiotics increases growth performance, improves the intestinal mucosal barrier and activates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway activity in chicks.","Probiotics comprise effective feed additives that can replace antibiotics in animal livestock production. However, mono-strain probiotics appear less effective because of their instability. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate dietary supplementation with compound probiotics (CPP) on growth performance, diarrhea rate and intestinal mucosal barrier, as well as the possible molecular mechanism, in chicks. In total, 360 1-day-old chicks of the Hy-Line Brown Chicks were randomly divided into the control group (CON, basal diet), chlortetracycline group (500 mg kg
The results showed that, in comparison with the CON group, CPP significantly increased the average daily feed intake and average daily gain of chicks and reduced diarrhea (P < 0.05). The probiotic group exhibited increased immune organ (i.e. spleen and thymus) mass and increased levels of serum immunoglobulin (Ig)A, IgM and IgG (P < 0.05) compared to the CTC group. In addition, the jejunal mass and morphology were improved in the probiotic group (P < 0.05). Moreover, CPP reinforced jejunal barrier function, as indicated by increased transepithelial electrical resistance, protein expression of occludin and claudin-1, and diamine oxidase levels in the jejunum (P < 0.05). Likewise, enhanced fluorescence signals of proliferating cell nuclear antigen-labeled mitotic cells and villin-labeled absorptive cells in the jejunum (P < 0.05) suggested that CPP promoted intestinal stem cells activity. Mechanistically, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, including β-catenin, TCF4, c-Myc, cyclin D1 and Lgr5, was amplified in the jejunum by CPP addition (P < 0.05).
The present study demonstrated that dietary supplementation with CPP reinforced the jejunal epithelial integrity by activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling and enhanced immune function in chicks. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.","['Wnt/β-catenin', 'chicks', 'compound probiotics', 'immune function', 'intestinal development']",Journal of the science of food and agriculture,10.1002/jsfa.12562,2023-03-18,"[{'lastname': 'Tong', 'firstname': 'Di-Qing', 'initials': 'DQ', 'affiliation': 'College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University/Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition Control/Guangdong Laboratory for Lingnan Modern Agriculture/State Key Laboratory of Livestock and Poultry Breeding, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Lu', 'firstname': 'Zhu-Jin', 'initials': 'ZJ', 'affiliation': 'College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University/Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition Control/Guangdong Laboratory for Lingnan Modern Agriculture/State Key Laboratory of Livestock and Poultry Breeding, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zeng', 'firstname': 'Nan', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University/Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition Control/Guangdong Laboratory for Lingnan Modern Agriculture/State Key Laboratory of Livestock and Poultry Breeding, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Xiu-Qi', 'initials': 'XQ', 'affiliation': 'College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University/Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition Control/Guangdong Laboratory for Lingnan Modern Agriculture/State Key Laboratory of Livestock and Poultry Breeding, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yan', 'firstname': 'Hui-Chao', 'initials': 'HC', 'affiliation': 'College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University/Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition Control/Guangdong Laboratory for Lingnan Modern Agriculture/State Key Laboratory of Livestock and Poultry Breeding, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Gao', 'firstname': 'Chun-Qi', 'initials': 'CQ', 'affiliation': 'College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University/Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition Control/Guangdong Laboratory for Lingnan Modern Agriculture/State Key Laboratory of Livestock and Poultry Breeding, Guangzhou, China.'}]",36930725,92c5771b-8f73-4790-8fb2-3f35f492d0fe,,DENIED: Wiley E Publisher says no to https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.12562/pdf

Group A was the control; group B was supplemented with 75 mg/kg chlortetracycline; groups C, D, and E were supplemented with 0.03, 0.06, and 0.09% CFA including glucose oxidase, curcumin, and Lactobacillus acidophilus; group F was supplemented with 0.03% CFA plus 0.50% glucose; group G was supplemented with 0.50% glucose. The feeding period was divided into the early (1-21 d) and later stages (22-42 d). The results showed that average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion rate (F/G) in group F in later stage were significantly better than those in the control and antibiotic groups; the diarrhea rates in the groups containing CFA in both stages was significantly lower than that in the control and antibiotic groups, indicating that CFA was better than antibiotics to improve growth and decrease diarrhea rate for broilers. Pathogenic E. coli challenge significantly increased diarrhea rates and decreased ADG for broilers; however, CFA addition could alleviate the above negative responses by increasing gut Lactobacillus abundance and decreasing Shigella abundance. It can be concluded that CFA can replace antibiotics to regulate intestinal microbiota, reduce diarrhea rate, and improve broiler growth.","['antibiotics alternative', 'broilers', 'compound feed additive', 'growth performance', 'gut microbiota']",Poultry science,10.1016/j.psj.2022.102302,2022-11-28,"[{'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Jingyan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'College of Animal Science and Technology, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou 450046, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Ping', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'College of Animal Science and Technology, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou 450046, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Chaoqi', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'College of Animal Science and Technology, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou 450046, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yin', 'firstname': 'Qingqiang', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'College of Animal Science and Technology, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou 450046, China.

Coli F18.,"Postweaning diarrhoea caused by Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a threat to the pig industry. With an intensified focus on finding alternatives to the use of medical zinc oxide and antibiotics in newly weaned pigs, the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of early inoculation of probiotics to suckling piglets on subsequently ETEC faecal shedding and immune parameters in ETEC F18-challenged weaned piglets. Sixty pigs weaned on day 28 of age were assigned to three treatment groups: (i) Negative Control (non-challenged), (ii) Positive Control (challenged) and (iii) Probiotic (challenged and inoculated with a multi-species probiotic product during suckling).

35727573,Lukasik et al.,Multispecies Probiotic for the Prevention of Antibiotic-Associated Diarrhea in Children: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"The efficacy of multispecies probiotic formulations in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) remains unclear.
To assess the effect of a multispecies probiotic on the risk of AAD in children.
This randomized, quadruple-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted from February 2018 to May 2021 in a multicenter, mixed setting (inpatients and outpatients). Patients were followed up throughout the intervention period. Eligibility criteria included age 3 months to 18 years, recruitment within 24 hours following initiation of broad-spectrum systemic antibiotics, and signed informed consent. In total, 646 eligible patients were approached and 350 patients took part in the trial.
A multispecies probiotic consisting of Bifidobacterium bifidum W23, Bifidobacterium lactis W51, Lactobacillus acidophilus W37, L acidophilus W55, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei W20, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum W62, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus W71, and Ligilactobacillus salivarius W24, for a total dose of 10 billion colony-forming units daily, for the duration of antibiotic treatment and for 7 days after.
The primary outcome was AAD, defined as 3 or more loose or watery stools per day in a 24-hour period, caused either by Clostridioides difficile or of otherwise unexplained etiology, after testing for common diarrheal pathogens. The secondary outcomes included diarrhea regardless of the etiology, diarrhea duration, and predefined diarrhea complications.
A total of 350 children (192 boys and 158 girls; mean [range] age, 50 [3-212] months) were randomized and 313 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Compared with placebo (n = 155), the probiotic (n = 158) had no effect on risk of AAD (relative risk [RR], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.49-1.33). However, children in the probiotic group had a lower risk of diarrhea regardless of the etiology (RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.44-0.94). No differences were observed between the groups for most of the secondary outcomes, including adverse events.
A multispecies probiotic did not reduce the risk of AAD in children when analyzed according to the most stringent definition. However, it reduced the overall risk of diarrhea during and for 7 days after antibiotic treatment. Our study also shows that the AAD definition has a significant effect on clinical trial results and their interpretation.

34385227,Goodman et al.,Probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"To evaluate existing evidence for the use of probiotics in preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) in adults.
Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs).
We performed a literature search of the electronic databases CINAHL Plus, EMBASE, MEDLINE (Ovid) and Web of Science from database inception to May 2021 as well as hand searching of trial registries and reference lists of related reviews.
Two reviewers identified whether RCTs met the following inclusion criteria: adult population to whom antibiotics were administered; a probiotic intervention; a placebo, alternative dose, alternative probiotic strain or no treatment control; and incidence of AAD as the outcome.
Two reviewers independently collected data and assessed risk of bias using preconstructed data extraction forms. We used a random effects model for all analyses. Subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate species-specific and dose-specific response.
Forty-two studies (11,305 participants) were included in this review. The pooled analysis suggests that co-administration of probiotics with antibiotics reduces the risk of AAD in adults by 37% (risk ratio (RR)=0.63 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.73), p<0.00001). The overall quality of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) criteria was found to be moderate. In subgroup analyses, high dose compared with low dose of the same probiotic demonstrated a positive protective effect (RR 0.54 (95% CI 0.38 to 0.76), p<0.01), and only certain species, mainly of the lactobacillus and bifidobacteria genera, were found to be effective. Studies with a low baseline AAD risk did not show any difference in risk but studies with moderate or high baseline AAD risk demonstrated a significant risk reduction.
Probiotics are effective for preventing AAD. Secondary analyses of higher dosages and certain species have shown increased effectiveness. Our results may not be applicable in clinical scenarios of lower baseline AAD risk.","['adult gastroenterology', 'bacteriology', 'gastroenterology', 'gastrointestinal infections', 'nutrition & dietetics', 'preventive medicine']",BMJ open,"10.1136/bmjopen-2020-043054

33573946,Karamzadeh-Dehaghani et al.,"Combined effect of probiotics and specific immunoglobulin Y directed against Escherichia coli on growth performance, diarrhea incidence, and immune system in calves.","Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) K99 is one of the major pathogens associated with calf diarrhea. The induction of passive immunity in animals by immunoglobulin Y and using probiotics are inexpensive alternatives to antibiotics for the prevention and treatment of a number of bacterial infections, including diarrhea. Hence, the aim of this research was to evaluate the impact of dietary probiotics and ETEC K99-specific egg yolk antibody supplements, alone and in combination with each other, on health and growth parameters, diarrhea incidence and immune stimulation in newborn Holstein calves. One hundred and twenty neonatal calves were allocated randomly into 4 dietary groups (n = 30 per group) received colostrum/milk without any additives (control group), or supplemented with egg yolk powder contained E. coli K99-specific antibody (Ab group; 1 g/day), a commercial probiotic, Hypro-calves (Pro group; 3 g/day), and their combination (Ab+Pro group), from day (d) 1 to d28 of age. Analyses of the growth parameters, feed efficiency, fecal score, and microbiota and immune function were carried out on d0, 14, 21, and 28 of the experiment. Calves in Ab or Ab+Pro group had higher (P < 0.05) average daily gain compared to control and Pro groups during 0-14d. Feed efficiency of calves in Ab and Ab+Pro groups was significantly higher than that in control group during the period of 0-14d; however, no significant differences were observed in 0-28d period. Diarrhea prevalence and fecal score in Ab+Pro group were lower than control group (P < 0.05). Calves in Ab+Pro group had the lowest number of fecal E. coli in comparison to other groups on d28 (P < 0.05). Feeding Ab+Pro supplement increased (P < 0.05) concentrations of blood IgA and serum CD4 compared to the control group. Likewise, calves in Pro group had higher CD4 levels as compared to the control calves (P < 0.05). Serum concentration of interferon-gamma in control group was lower than other groups (P < 0.05). Overall, these data suggest that feeding a combination of probiotic and specific antibody against ETEC to neonate Holstein calves enhances feed efficiency, boosts immunity, and reduces diarrhea prevalence.","['Chicken egg yolk immunoglobulin', 'Cytokines', 'E. coli', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Performance']",Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience,10.1016/j.animal.2020.100124,2021-02-13,"[{'lastname': 'Karamzadeh-Dehaghani', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Animal Science, Campus of Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of Tehran, Karaj, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Towhidi', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Animal Science, Campus of Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of Tehran, Karaj, Iran.

33295643,Collinson et al.,Probiotics for treating acute infectious diarrhoea.,"Probiotics may be effective in reducing the duration of acute infectious diarrhoea.
To assess the effects of probiotics in proven or presumed acute infectious diarrhoea.
We searched the trials register of the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group, MEDLINE, and Embase from inception to 17 December 2019, as well as the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 12, 2019), in the Cochrane Library, and reference lists from studies and reviews. We included additional studies identified during external review.
Randomized controlled trials comparing a specified probiotic agent with a placebo or no probiotic in people with acute diarrhoea that is proven or presumed to be caused by an infectious agent.
Two review authors independently applied inclusion criteria, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. Primary outcomes were measures of diarrhoea duration (diarrhoea lasting ≥ 48 hours; duration of diarrhoea). Secondary outcomes were number of people hospitalized in community studies, duration of hospitalization in inpatient studies, diarrhoea lasting ≥ 14 days, and adverse events.
We included 82 studies with a total of 12,127 participants. These studies included 11,526 children (age < 18 years) and 412 adults (three studies recruited 189 adults and children but did not specify numbers in each age group). No cluster-randomized trials were included. Studies varied in the definitions used for ""acute diarrhoea"" and ""end of the diarrhoeal illness"" and in the probiotic(s) tested. A total of 53 trials were undertaken in countries where both child and adult mortality was low or very low, and 26 where either child or adult mortality was high. Risk of bias was high or unclear in many studies, and there was marked statistical heterogeneity when findings for the primary outcomes were pooled in meta-analysis. Effect size was similar in the sensitivity analysis and marked heterogeneity persisted. Publication bias was demonstrated from funnel plots for the main outcomes. In our main analysis of the primary outcomes in studies at low risk for all indices of risk of bias, no difference was detected between probiotic and control groups for the risk of diarrhoea lasting ≥ 48 hours (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.09; 2 trials, 1770 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); or for duration of diarrhoea (mean difference (MD) 8.64 hours shorter, 95% CI 29.4 hours shorter to 12.1 hours longer; 6 trials, 3058 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Effect size was similar and marked heterogeneity persisted in pre-specified subgroup analyses of the primary outcomes that included all studies. These included analyses limited to the probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Saccharomyces boulardii. In six trials (433 participants) of Lactobacillus reuteri, there was consistency amongst findings (I² = 0%), but risk of bias was present in all included studies. Heterogeneity also was not explained by types of participants (age, nutritional/socioeconomic status captured by mortality stratum, region of the world where studies were undertaken), diarrhoea in children caused by rotavirus, exposure to antibiotics, and the few studies of children who were also treated with zinc. In addition, there were no clear differences in effect size for the primary outcomes in post hoc analyses according to decade of publication of studies and whether or not trials had been registered. For other outcomes, the duration of hospitalization in inpatient studies on average was shorter in probiotic groups than in control groups but there was marked heterogeneity between studies (I² = 96%; MD -18.03 hours, 95% CI -27.28 to -8.78, random-effects model: 24 trials, 4056 participants). No differences were detected between probiotic and control groups in the number of people with diarrhoea lasting ≥ 14 days (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.53; 9 studies, 2928 participants) or in risk of hospitalization in community studies (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.89; 6 studies, 2283 participants). No serious adverse events were attributed to probiotics.
Probiotics probably make little or no difference to the number of people who have diarrhoea lasting 48 hours or longer, and we are uncertain whether probiotics reduce the duration of diarrhoea. This analysis is based on large trials with low risk of bias.
پیشینه: پروبیوتیک‌ها ممکن است در کاهش مدت زمان ابتلا به اسهال عفونی حاد موثر باشند. اهداف: ارزیابی اثرات پروبیوتیک‌ها بر موارد تائید شده یا مشکوک به ابتلا به اسهال عفونی حاد. روش‌های جست‌وجو: پایگاه‌های ثبت کارآزمایی‌های گروه بیماری‌های عفونی در کاکرین، MEDLINE و Embase را از ابتدا تا 17 دسامبر 2019، همچنین پایگاه ثبت کارآزمایی‌های کنترل شده کاکرین (شماره 12، 2019) را در کتابخانه کاکرین، و فهرست منابع مطالعات و مرورها را جست‌وجو کردیم. مطالعات بیشتر که حین مرور خارجی شناسایی شدند، وارد شدند. معیارهای انتخاب: کارآزمایی‌های تصادفی‌سازی و کنترل شده‌ای که به مقایسه یک عامل پروبیوتیک مشخص با دارونما (placebo) یا عدم تجویز پروبیوتیک در افراد مبتلا به اسهال حادی پرداختند که ایجاد آن با یک عامل عفونی، تائید شده یا مشکوک به وجود آن بودند. گردآوری و تجزیه‌وتحلیل داده‌ها: دو نویسنده مرور به‌طور مستقل از هم، معیار واجد شرایط بودن را اعمال، خطر سوگیری (bias) را ارزیابی، و داده‌ها را استخراج کردند. پیامدهای اولیه عبارت بودند از معیارهای مربوط به مدت زمان اسهال (اسهالی که به مدت 48 ساعت یا بیشتر طول بکشد؛ مدت زمان اسهال). پیامدهای ثانویه، تعداد افراد بستری در بیمارستان در مطالعات انجام شده در سطح جامعه، طول مدت بستری در بیمارستان در مطالعات انجام شده روی بیماران بستری، اسهالی که 14 روز یا بیشتر طول بکشد، و عوارض جانبی، بودند. نتایج اصلی: ما 82 مطالعه را، با مجموع 12,127 شرکت‌کننده، وارد کردیم. این مطالعات شامل 11,526 کودک (سن < 18 سال) و 412 بزرگسال بودند (سه مطالعه 189 بزرگسال و کودک را وارد کردند اما تعداد آنها را در هر گروه سنی نشان ندادند). هیچ کارآزمایی تصادفی‌‌سازی شده خوشه‌ای گنجانده نشد. مطالعات در تعاریف استفاده شده برای «اسهال حاد» و «پایان بیماری اسهال» و در پروبیوتیک(های) آزمایش شده، متفاوت بودند. در کل 53 کارآزمایی در کشورهایی انجام شدند که هم مورتالیتی کودکان و هم مورتالیتی بزرگسالان پائین یا بسیار پائین بودند، و 26 مطالعه هم در کشورهایی با مورتالیتی بالای کودکان یا بزرگسالان به سرانجام رسیدند. خطر سوگیری در بسیاری از مطالعات بالا یا نامشخص گزارش شد، و هنگامی که یافته‌های پیامدهای اولیه در متاآنالیز جمع شدند، ناهمگونی آماری قابل توجهی مشخص بود. اندازه تاثیرگذاری درمان در آنالیز حساسیت (sensitivity analysis) مشابه بوده و ناهمگونی مشخصی باقی ماند. سوگیری انتشار از نمودارهای قیفی (funnel plot) برای پیامدهای اصلی نشان داده شد. در آنالیز اصلی ما از پیامدهای اولیه در مطالعات کم‌خطر از نظر همه شاخص‌های خطر سوگیری، هیچ تفاوتی بین گروه‌های پروبیوتیک و کنترل برای خطر ابتلا به اسهالی که به مدت 48 ساعت یا بیشتر طول بکشد (خطر نسبی (RR): 1.00؛ 95% فاصله اطمینان (CI): 0.91 تا 1.09؛ 2 کارآزمایی، 1770 شرکت‌کننده؛ شواهد با قطعیت متوسط) یا برای طول دوره اسهال (تفاوت میانگین (MD): 8.64 ساعت کوتاه‌تر؛ 95% CI؛ 29.4 ساعت کوتاه‌تر تا 12.1 ساعت طولانی‌تر؛ 6 کارآزمایی، 3058 شرکت‌کننده؛ شواهد با قطعیت بسیار پائین)، دیده نشد. اندازه تاثیرگذاری درمان مشابه بوده و ناهمگونی واضحی در آنالیزهای زیرگروه از پیش تعیین شده برای پیامدهای اولیه که شامل تمام مطالعات می‌شد، ادامه داشت. این زیرگروه‌ها شامل آنالیزهای محدود به پروبیوتیک‌های Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG و Saccharomyces boulardii بودند. در شش کارآزمایی (433 شرکت‌کننده) از Lactobacillus reuteri، بین یافته‌ها سازگاری دیده شد (%0 = I²)، اما خطر سوگیری در همه مطالعات وارد شده وجود داشت. ناهمگونی با انواع شرکت‌کنندگان (سن، وضعیت تغذیه‌ای/اجتماعی‌اقتصادی گرفته شده از رتبه مورتالیتی، منطقه‌ای از جهان که مطالعات انجام شدند)، اسهال در کودکان که ناشی از روتاویروس باشد، مصرف آنتی‌بیوتیک‌ها، و چند مطالعه در مورد کودکانی که با روی هم درمان شدند، نیز توجیه نشدند. علاوه بر این، با توجه به دهه زمانی انتشار مطالعات و اینکه کارآزمایی‌ها ثبت شده بودند یا خیر، تفاوت‌های مشخصی در اندازه تاثیرگذاری برای پیامدهای اولیه در آنالیزهای post hoc وجود نداشت. برای سایر پیامدها، طول مدت بستری در بیمارستان در مطالعات انجام شده در شرایط بستری، به‌طور متوسط در گروه‌های پروبیوتیک نسبت به گروه کنترل کمتر بود اما بین مطالعات ناهمگونی واضحی دیده شد (I² = 96%؛ MD؛ 18.03‐ ساعت؛ 95% CI؛ 27.28‐ تا 8.78‐، مدل اثرات تصادفی: 24 کارآزمایی، 4056 شرکت‌کننده). هیچ تفاوتی بین گروه‌های پروبیوتیک و کنترل در تعداد افراد مبتلا به اسهالی که 14 روز یا بیشتر طول کشیده باشد (RR: 0.49؛ 95% CI؛ 0.16 تا 1.53؛ 9 مطالعه، 2928 شرکت‌کننده) یا در معرض خطر بستری شدن در مطالعات انجام شده در سطح جامعه باشند (RR: 1.2؛ 95% CI؛ 0.84 تا 1.89؛ 6 مطالعه، 2283 شرکت‌کننده) دیده نشد. هیچ عارضه جانبی جدی به پروبیوتیک‌ها نسبت داده نشد. نتیجه‌گیری‌های نویسندگان: پروبیوتیک‌ها احتمالا تفاوتی اندک یا عدم تفاوت در تعداد افرادی ایجاد می‌کنند که اسهال آنها 48 ساعت یا بیشتر طول کشیده باشد، و ما مطمئن نیستیم که پروبیوتیک‌ها طول دوره اسهال را کاهش می‌دهند یا خیر. این آنالیز بر اساس یافته‌های کارآزمایی‌های بزرگ با خطر پائین سوگیری انجام شد.",[],The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"10.1002/14651858.CD003048.pub4

33234881,Liao et al.,Probiotics for the Prevention of Antibiotic-associated Diarrhea in Adults: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trials.,"This meta-analysis aims to combine the latest research evidence to assess the effect of probiotics on preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) in adults.
PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched for randomized placebo-controlled trials on probiotics preventing AAD. A random or fixed effect model was used to combine the incidence of AAD (primary outcome) and the adverse event rates. The authors performed subgroup analyses to explore the effects of different participants population, probiotics species, and dosage.
Thirty-six studies were included with 9312 participants. Probiotics reduced the incidence of AAD by 38% (pooled relative risk, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.51-0.74). The protective effect of probiotics was still significant when grouped by reasons for antibiotics treatment, probiotic duration, probiotic dosage, and time from antibiotic to probiotic. However, there were no statistically significant increased adverse events in the probiotics group (relative risk, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.87-1.14).
This updated meta-analysis suggested that using probiotics as early as possible during antibiotic therapy has a positive and safe effect on preventing AAD in adults. Further studies should focus on the optimal dosage and duration of probiotics to develop a specific recommendation.",[],Journal of clinical gastroenterology,10.1097/MCG.0000000000001464,2020-11-26,"[{'lastname': 'Liao', 'firstname': 'Wanqian', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Intensive Care Unit.\nInfection Control Department, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Chongxiang', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Intensive Care Unit.\nInfection Control Department, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou.'}, {'lastname': 'Wen', 'firstname': 'Tianmeng', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': ""School of Public Health, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Zhao', 'firstname': 'Qingyu', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'Department of Intensive Care Unit.\nInfection Control Department, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou.'}]","33234881

33217518,Qu et al.,Effects of fermented ginseng on the gut microbiota and immunity of rats with antibiotic-associated diarrhea.,"Ginseng (Panax ginseng Meyer) is a well-known herb in traditional Chinese medicine and has been used to treat many diseases for thousands of years. Recent studies have shown that ginseng is a promising agent for improving the gut microbiota and treating ulcerative colitis. Fermentation is a common process in traditional Chinese medicine making that can be used to enhance efficacy and reduce toxicity.
The purpose of the present study was to research the efficacy of ginseng fermented with probiotics (Lactobacillus fermentum) on the gut microbiota and immunity of rats with antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD).
SPF Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into eight groups: control group, antibiotic group, natural recovery group, and five groups treated with different doses of fermented ginseng (FG1 to FG5). A model of AAD was established by treating the rats with triple antibiotics, and obvious symptoms of AAD were observed. A histopathological analysis of the colon was performed. The total bacteria in the intestinal microbiota and five types of gut microbes in the feces were detected by quantitative PCR. The expression levels of related immune factors TLR4 and NF-κB in the colon were assayed.
An appropriate dose of fermented ginseng (0.5 g/kg/d) relieved some of the symptoms of AAD and colon inflammation and reduced the expression of the immune factors TLR4 and NF-κB in the colon. The alteration of the gut microbiota observed in the rats treated with antibiotics also returned to normal after treatment with fermented ginseng. Moreover, different doses of fermented ginseng exerted different influences on the gut microbiota, and excessively high or low doses of fermented ginseng were disadvantageous for resolving the symptoms of AAD and promoting recovery.
These results demonstrate that fermented ginseng can treat AAD symptoms and colon inflammation and restore the gut microbiota to its original state.","['Antibiotic-associated diarrhea', 'Fermentation', 'Ginseng', 'Gut microbiota']",Journal of ethnopharmacology,10.1016/j.jep.2020.113594,2020-11-21,"[{'lastname': 'Qu', 'firstname': 'Qingsong', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'School of Life Science, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Yangguang South Street, Fangshan, 102488, Beijing, China.

32035998,Rajkumar et al.,Do probiotics prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhoea? Results of a multicentre randomized placebo-controlled trial.,"Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) is a side-effect of antibiotic consumption and probiotics have been shown to reduce AAD.
A multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial was conducted to evaluate the role of Lactobacillus casei DN114001 (combined as a drink with two regular yoghurt bacterial strains) in reducing AAD and Clostridioides difficile infection in patients aged over 55 years. The primary outcome was the incidence of AAD during 2 weeks of follow-up.
A total of 1127 patients (mean age ± standard deviation: 73.6 ± 10.5) were randomized to the active group (N = 549) or placebo group (N = 577). Both groups were followed up as per protocol. The proportion of patients experiencing AAD during follow-up was 19.3% (106/549) in the probiotic group vs 17.9% (103/577) in the placebo group (unadjusted odds ratio 1.10, 95% confidence interval 0.82-1.49, P = 0.53).
No significant evidence was found of a beneficial effect of the specific probiotic formulation in preventing AAD in this elderly population drawn from a number of different UK hospitals. However, in the UK and in many other healthcare systems there have, in recent years, been many changes in antibiotic stewardship policies, an overall decrease in incidence in C. difficile infection, as well as an increased awareness of infection prevention, and modifications in nursing practice. In light of these factors, it is impossible to conclude definitively from the current trial that the study-specific probiotic formulation has no role in preventing AAD, and it is our view that further trials may be indicated, controlling for these variables.","['Antibiotics', 'Antibiotics associated diarrhoea', 'C. difficile', 'Elderly', 'Infection', 'Probiotics']",The Journal of hospital infection,10.1016/j.jhin.2020.01.018,2020-02-10,"[{'lastname': 'Rajkumar', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Brighton and Sussex Medical School, Universities of Brighton & Sussex, Brighton, UK.

To investigate whether the use of a multispecies probiotic can prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in people with spinal cord injury (SCI).
Three Dutch SCI rehabilitation centres.
Fifty-six people aged 18-75 years with SCI during inpatient rehabilitation, who require antibiotics, will be given probiotics or placebo randomly assigned (T0). After cessation of the antibiotics (T1), the participants will use probiotics/placebo for 3 more weeks (T2). Defaecation, assessed by the Bristol Stool Scale, and bowel management will be monitored daily until 2 weeks after cessation of probiotics/placebo intake (T3). Also, the degree of nausea and information on quality of life will be collected at T0, T1, T2 and T3.
The difference between the incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea between people with SCI using probiotics compared to those using a placebo at the moment the antibiotics stops, the probiotics stops and two weeks thereafter.
The time to reach effective bowel management, degree of nausea and quality of life.

31340751,Zaharuddin et al.,A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of probiotics in post-surgical colorectal cancer.,"Our study aimed to determine the effect of probiotic consumption containing six viable microorganisms of 30 × 10
Fifty-two patients with colorectal cancer were randomized at four weeks after surgery to receive either a placebo (n = 25) or 30 billion colony-forming unit (CFU) of a mixture of six viable strains including 107 mg of Lactobacillus acidophilus BCMC® 12,130, Lactobacillus lactis BCMC® 12,451, Lactobacillus casei subsp BCMC® 12,313, Bifidobacterium longum BCMC® 02120, Bifidobacterium bifidum BCMC® 02290 and Bifidobacterium infantis BCMC® 02129 (n = 27). Patients were instructed to take the product orally twice daily for six months. Infection status, diarrhea or hospital admission were recorded throughout the study. Blood was taken pre- and post-intervention to measure TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17A, IL-17C and IL-22 using ELISA multiplex kit.
The majority of cases (~ 70%) were in Duke's C colorectal cancer for both groups. No surgical infection occurred and no antibiotics were required. Chemotherapy induced diarrhea was observed in both groups. Significant reduction in the level of pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17A, IL-17C and IL-22 were observed in CRC patients who received probiotics as compared to pre-treatment level (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the IFN-γ in both groups.
We have shown that probiotics containing six viable microorganisms of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria strains are safe to be consumed at four weeks after surgery in colorectal cancer patients and have reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (except for IFN-gamma). Probiotic may modify intestinal microenvironment resulting in a decline in pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 2-way, 2-period, crossover study with an 8-week washout period. Each period included a 1-week baseline and 3-week treatment phase. Dogs received enrofloxacin (10 mg/kg PO q24h) and metronidazole (12.5 mg/kg PO q12h), followed 1 hour later by a bacterial/yeast synbiotic combination or placebo. Food intake, vomiting, and fecal score were compared using repeated-measures crossover analyses, with P < .05 considered significant.
Hyporexia, vomiting, and diarrhea occurred in 41% (95% confidence interval [CI], 21-64), 77% (95% CI, 55-92), and 100% (95% CI, 85-100) of dogs, respectively, during the first treatment period. Derangements in food intake were smaller in both periods for dogs receiving synbiotics (F-value, 5.1; P = .04) with treatment-by-period interactions (F-value, 6.0; P = .02). Days of vomiting differed over time (F-value, 4.7; P = .006). Fecal scores increased over time (F-value, 33.5; P < .001), were lower during period 2 (F-value, 14.5; P = .001), and had treatment-by-period effects (F-value, 4.8; P = .04).
Enrofloxacin/metronidazole administration is associated with a high frequency of AAGS. Synbiotic administration decreases food intake derangements. The presence of milder AAGS in period 2 suggests that clinical effects of synbiotics persist >9 weeks after discontinuation, mitigating AAGS in dogs being treated with antibiotics followed by placebo.","['saccharomyces boulardii', 'antibiotic-associated diarrhea', 'antibiotic-associated gastrointestinal signs', 'diarrhea and vomiting', 'probiotic']",Journal of veterinary internal medicine,10.1111/jvim.15553,2019-07-04,"[{'lastname': 'Whittemore', 'firstname': 'Jacqueline C', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee.'}, {'lastname': 'Moyers', 'firstname': 'Tamberlyn D', 'initials': 'TD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee.'}, {'lastname': 'Price', 'firstname': 'Joshua M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Office of Information Technology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee.'}]","31268578

31144409,Tan et al.,Effect of chicken egg yolk immunoglobulins on serum biochemical profiles and intestinal bacterial populations in early-weaned piglets.,"This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that dietary supplementation with anti-E. coli, chicken egg yolk immunoglobulins (IgY), may affect early weaned piglet (EWP) intestinal functions and enteric micro-organisms. One hundred and forty-eight ([Landrace × Yorkshire] × Duroc) piglets, weaned at age day 21, were randomly assigned to receive one of three diets for 14 days. Treatment group one (control group) was fed the base diet. Treatment group two (antibiotics group) was fed the base diet which was supplemented with 100 ppm colistin sulphate and 15 ppm enramycin; treatment group three (IgY group) was fed the base diet which was supplemented with 500 mg/kg anti-E. coli IgY. The study evaluated the effects on EWPs of IgY on growth, serum biochemical, inflammatory profiles and also digestion content intestinal bacterial populations. Results showed no significant difference in diarrhoea rates between IgY-fed EWPs and antibiotic-treated EWPs. Serum biochemical analysis showed that EWPs fed an IgY-containing diet had both lower (p < 0.05) cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein compared to antibiotic-treated EWPs. Escherichia coli populations measured in IgY-fed EWP ileal contents, compared to the control group, were significantly reduced (p < 0.05). Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Clostridium and Bifidobacterium populations were unaffected by the IgY treatment. Larger (p < 0.05) Enterococcus populations and lower (p < 0.05) expression levels of heat-stable enterotoxin b (STb) were observed in IgY-fed EWP caecal digesta compared to the control group. Enteric Lactobacillus significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in EWPs fed antibiotics while it was unaffected by IgY treatment. Dietary supplementation with anti-E. coli IgY has the potential to suppress enteric E. coli growth, but not Lactobacillus, Clostridium and Bifidobacterium. This promotes and maintains a healthy EWP intestinal environment. These findings suggest that IgY may be used as an alternative to antibiotics in EWP diets.","['antibiotic', 'diarrhoea', 'early weaned piglets', 'egg yolk immunoglobulins', 'gut microflora']",Journal of animal physiology and animal nutrition,"10.1111/jpn.13129

31039287,Guo et al.,Probiotics for the prevention of pediatric antibiotic-associated diarrhea.,"Antibiotics alter the microbial balance commonly resulting in antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Probiotics may prevent AAD via providing gut barrier, restoration of the gut microflora, and other potential mechanisms of action.
The primary objectives were to assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics (any specified strain or dose) used for the prevention of AAD in children.
MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and the Web of Science (inception to 28 May 2018) were searched along with registers including the ISRCTN and Clinicaltrials.gov. We also searched the NICE Evidence Services database as well as reference lists from relevant articles.
Randomized, parallel, controlled trials in children (0 to 18 years) receiving antibiotics, that compare probiotics to placebo, active alternative prophylaxis, or no treatment and measure the incidence of diarrhea secondary to antibiotic use were considered for inclusion.
Study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were conducted independently by two authors. Dichotomous data (incidence of AAD, adverse events) were combined using a pooled risk ratio (RR) or risk difference (RD), and continuous data (mean duration of diarrhea) as mean difference (MD), along with corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). We calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) where appropriate. For studies reporting on microbiome characteristics using heterogeneous outcomes, we describe the results narratively. The certainty of the evidence was evaluated using GRADE.
Thirty-three studies (6352 participants) were included. Probiotics assessed included Bacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Clostridium butyricum, Lactobacilli spp., Lactococcus spp., Leuconostoc cremoris, Saccharomyces spp., orStreptococcus spp., alone or in combination. The risk of bias was determined to be high in 20 studies and low in 13 studies. Complete case (patients who did not complete the studies were not included in the analysis) results from 33 trials reporting on the incidence of diarrhea show a precise benefit from probiotics compared to active, placebo or no treatment control.After 5 days to 12 weeks of follow-up, the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% (259/3232) compared to 19% (598/3120) in the control group (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.56; I² = 57%, 6352 participants; NNTB 9, 95% CI 7 to 13; moderate certainty evidence). Nineteen studies had loss to follow-up ranging from 1% to 46%. After making assumptions for those lost, the observed benefit was still statistically significant using an extreme plausible intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, wherein the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 12% (436/3551) compared to 19% (664/3468) in the control group (7019 participants; RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.49 to 0.77; P <0.00001; I² = 70%). An a priori available case subgroup analysis exploring heterogeneity indicated that high dose (≥ 5 billion CFUs per day) is more effective than low probiotic dose (< 5 billion CFUs per day), interaction P value = 0.01. For the high dose studies the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% (162/2029) compared to 23% (462/2009) in the control group (4038 participants; RR 0.37; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.46; P = 0.06; moderate certainty evidence). For the low dose studies the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% (97/1155) compared to 13% (133/1059) in the control group (2214 participants; RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.01; P = 0.02). Again, assumptions for loss to follow-up using an extreme plausible ITT analysis was statistically significant. For high dose studies the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 13% (278/2218) compared to 23% (503/2207) in control group (4425 participants; RR 0.54; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.70; P <0.00001; I² = 68%; moderate certainty evidence).None of the 24 trials (4415 participants) that reported on adverse events reported any serious adverse events attributable to probiotics. Adverse event rates were low. After 5 days to 4 weeks follow-up, 4% (86/2229) of probiotics participants had an adverse event compared to 6% (121/2186) of control participants (RD 0.00; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01; P < 0.00001; I² = 75%; low certainty evidence). Common adverse events included rash, nausea, gas, flatulence, abdominal bloating, and constipation.After 10 days to 12 weeks of follow-up, eight studies recorded data on our secondary outcome, the mean duration of diarrhea; with probiotics reducing diarrhea duration by almost one day (MD -0.91; 95% CI -1.38 to -0.44; P <0.00001; low certainty evidence). One study reported on microbiome characteristics, reporting no difference in changes with concurrent antibiotic and probiotic use.
The overall evidence suggests a moderate protective effect of probiotics for preventing AAD (NNTB 9, 95% CI 7 to 13). Using five criteria to evaluate the credibility of the subgroup analysis on probiotic dose, the results indicate the subgroup effect based on high dose probiotics (≥ 5 billion CFUs per day) was credible. Based on high-dose probiotics, the NNTB to prevent one case of diarrhea is 6 (95% CI 5 to 9). The overall certainty of the evidence for the primary endpoint, incidence of AAD based on high dose probiotics was moderate due to the minor issues with risk of bias and inconsistency related to a diversity of probiotic agents used. Evidence also suggests that probiotics may moderately reduce the duration of diarrhea, a reduction by almost one day. The benefit of high dose probiotics (e.g. Lactobacillus rhamnosus orSaccharomyces boulardii) needs to be confirmed by a large well-designed multi-centered randomized trial. It is premature to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy and safety of 'other' probiotic agents as an adjunct to antibiotics in children. Adverse event rates were low and no serious adverse events were attributable to probiotics. Although no serious adverse events were observed among inpatient and outpatient children, including small studies conducted in the intensive care unit and in the neonatal unit, observational studies not included in this review have reported serious adverse events in severely debilitated or immuno-compromised children with underlying risk factors including central venous catheter use and disorders associated with bacterial/fungal translocation.",[],The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"10.1002/14651858.CD004827.pub5

The primary outcomes were the time to last unformed stool (TTLUS), number of unformed stools, change in severity of abdominal pain, time to complete resolution of abdominal discomfort, complete remission of diarrhea, and quality of life (QoL). The secondary outcomes were physical examination and vitals, hematological analysis, and assessment of reported adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs).
Trial data showed that the LAB was well-tolerated by participants at the dose provided. The LAB was effective in recovering from acute diarrhea with abdominal pain and discomforts and exhibited improved cluster of QoL. No AEs or SAEs were reported during the trial.
It is evident that the test drug, i.e., LAB (B. coagulans strain LBSC) is safe and effective for improving the pathophysiological conditions related to acute diarrhea and abdominal discomfort evaluated through stage-II clinical trial.","['Abdominal pain', 'Bacillus coagulans', 'Bristol stool scale', 'Diarrhea', 'Quality of life']",European journal of clinical pharmacology,10.1007/s00228-018-2562-x,2018-09-29,"[{'lastname': 'Maity', 'firstname': 'Chiranjit', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Probiotics Laboratory, Advanced Enzyme Technologies Ltd., 5th Floor, A-Wing, Sun Magnetica, LIC Service Road, Louiswadi, Thane (W), Maharashtra, 400 604, India. chiranjit@advancedenzymes.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Gupta', 'firstname': 'Anil Kumar', 'initials': 'AK', 'affiliation': 'Probiotics Laboratory, Advanced Enzyme Technologies Ltd., 5th Floor, A-Wing, Sun Magnetica, LIC Service Road, Louiswadi, Thane (W), Maharashtra, 400 604, India.'}]","30264164

30261077,Ziese et al.,"Effect of probiotic treatment on the clinical course, intestinal microbiome, and toxigenic Clostridium perfringens in dogs with acute hemorrhagic diarrhea.","The impact of probiotics on dogs with acute hemorrhagic diarrhea syndrome (AHDS) has not been evaluated so far. The study aim was to assess the effect of probiotic treatment on the clinical course, intestinal microbiome, and toxigenic Clostridium perfringens in dogs with AHDS in a prospective, placebo-controlled, blinded trial.
Twenty-five dogs with AHDS with no signs of sepsis were randomly divided into a probiotic (PRO; Visbiome, ExeGi Pharma) and placebo group (PLAC). Treatment was administered for 21 days without antibiotics. Clinical signs were evaluated daily from day 0 to day 8. Key bacterial taxa, C. perfringens encoding NetF toxin and enterotoxin were assessed on days 0, 7, 21.
Both groups showed a rapid clinical improvement. In PRO a significant clinical recovery was observed on day 3 (p = 0.008), while in PLAC it was observed on day 4 (p = 0.002) compared to day 0. Abundance of Blautia (p<0.001) and Faecalibacterium (p = 0.035) was significantly higher in PRO on day 7 compared to day 0, while in PLAC the abundance of Faecalibacterium was not significantly higher on any study day and Blautia (p = 0.016) was only significantly higher on day 21 compared to day 0. Abundance of C. perfringens was significantly lower on day 7 (p = 0.011) compared to day 0 in PRO but not in PLAC. Enterotoxin genes were significantly lower in PRO on day 21 (p = 0.028) compared to PLAC. Fecal samples of 57% of all dogs were positive for netF toxin genes on day 0 and the abundance was significantly lower on day 7 compared to day 0 in PRO (p = 0.016) and PLAC (p = 0.031).
The probiotic treatment was associated with an accelerated normalization of the intestinal microbiome. Dogs with aseptic AHDS showed a rapid decrease of netF toxin genes and fast clinical recovery in both groups under symptomatic treatment without antibiotics.",[],PloS one,"10.1371/journal.pone.0204691

30078376,Agamennone et al.,A practical guide for probiotics applied to the case of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in The Netherlands.,"Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is a side-effect frequently associated with the use of broad spectrum antibiotics. Although a number of clinical studies show that co-administration of specific probiotics reduces the risk for AAD, there is still unclarity among healthcare professionals on the recommendation of probiotic products. This paper aims at a practical guide to inform healthcare professionals, patients and consumers about the exact product characteristics of available probiotics with a proven efficacy to prevent AAD.
The workflow in this paper includes three consecutive steps: 1) systematic review of relevant clinical studies for effective probiotics by a meta-analysis, 2) compilation of a list of available probiotic products, and 3) recommendation of probiotic products that match effective formulations. Our systematic review on the efficacy of probiotics for the prevention of AAD included only studies with randomized, double blind placebo-controlled trials, a clear definition of antibiotic associated diarrhea, and a probiotic administration regime for at least the duration of the antibiotic therapy.
Using our inclusion criteria, we selected 32 out of 128 identified trials and pooled the results of these studies for each specific dairy product and food supplement. The results indicate a total of seven single or multiple-strain formulations favoring the probiotic treatment group, with the strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG being the most effective [relative risk ratio of probiotic versus placebo 0.30 (95% CI 0.16-0.5)]. We selected products for recommendation from a compiled list of all probiotic dairy products and food supplements available in The Netherlands and categorized them into groups of products showing effects against the incidence of AAD in at least one, two or three independent clinical studies. We excluded all products which did not unambiguously declare on the label the specific probiotic strain(s) and the number of colony forming units.
Here we present a practical guide that informs healthcare professionals and patients on the availability of probiotic products with a proven efficacy for the prevention of AAD.","['Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD)', 'Antibiotics', 'Meta-analysis', 'Probiotics']",BMC gastroenterology,"10.1186/s12876-018-0831-x

30037757,Shimizu et al.,Association of prophylactic synbiotics with reduction in diarrhea and pneumonia in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients: A propensity score analysis.,"The preventive association of synbiotics therapy has not been thoroughly clarified in mechanically ventilated patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether synbiotics therapy has preventive association against septic complications in ventilated critically ill patients.
Critically ill patients who were mechanically ventilated were included in this retrospective observational study. Patients who received synbiotics (Bifidobacterium breve, Lactobacillus casei, and galactooligosaccharides) within 3 days after admission (denoted as synbiotics group) were compared with patients who did not receive synbiotics. The incidences of enteritis, pneumonia, and bacteremia were evaluated as clinical outcome. Enteritis was defined as an acute onset of diarrhea consisting of continuous liquid watery stools for more than 12 h. The confounding factors include APACHE II on admission, gender, the cause of admission and antibiotics.
We included 179 patients in this study: 57 patients received synbiotics and 122 patients did not receive synbiotics. The incidences of enteritis were significantly lower in the synbiotics group compared with the control group (3.5% vs. 15.6%; p < 0.05). The odds ratios for diarrhea-free days during the first 28 days for the synbiotics group as compared with the controls were 4.354 (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.407 to 7.877; p < 0.001) in an ordinal logistic regression model with propensity scores. The odds ratios for pneumonia-free days during the first 28 days for the synbiotics group were 2.529 (95% CI, 1.715 to 3.731; p < 0.001). The incidences of bacteremia did not have significant differences.

30020891,Litao et al.,Risk Factors for Antibiotic-Associated Diarrhea in Critically Ill Patients.,"BACKGROUND We analyzed the factors related to AAD to inform the rational use of antibiotics in critically ill patients and to reduce the incidence of AAD by providing a reference for antibiotic use in the clinical setting. MATERIAL AND METHODS This study was a retrospective analysis of the clinical data of patients who were hospitalized in the ICU of the First Teaching Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2016. Patients with AAD were assigned to the case group, and all others were assigned to the control group. Basic data were collected for all the selected patients. All the relevant data were analyzed with univariate or multivariate regression analyses, and P<0.05 was considered statistical significance. RESULTS A total of 293 patients were enrolled. Statistical analyses showed that gender (OR 1.915; 95% [CI] 1.061-3.455; P=0.031), parenteral nutrition (OR 1.877; 95% [CI] 1.043-3.377; P=0.036), preventive use of probiotics (OR 0.497; 95% [CI] 0.285-0.866; P=0.014), APACHE II score upon admission to the ICU (OR 0.961; 95% [CI] 0.927-0.998; P=0.037) and use of enzyme-inhibitor antibiotics (OR 1.899; 95% [CI] 1.044-3.420; P=0.016) were associated with AAD. Further subgroup analysis by gender showed that parenteral nutrition (OR 2.144; 95% [CI] 1.064-4.322; P=0.033), preventive use of probiotics (OR 0.367; 95% [CI] 0.186-0.722; P=0.004), and APACHE II score upon admission to the ICU (OR 1.055; 95% [CI] 1.011-1.101; P=0.014) were associated with AAD in critically ill male patients. Age (OR 0.975; 95% [CI] 0.951-0.999; P=0.041) and use of carbapenem antibiotics (OR 4.826; 95% [CI] 1.011-23.030; P=0.048) were associated with AAD in critically ill female patients. CONCLUSIONS Parenteral nutrition, prophylactic use of probiotics, use of enzyme-inhibitor antibiotics, and use of combinations of antibiotics were associated with AAD in critically ill patients.

29799833,Soler et al.,Digestive microbiota is different in pigs receiving antimicrobials or a feed additive during the nursery period.,"Antimicrobials have been used in a prophylactic way to decrease the incidence of digestive disorders during the piglet post-weaning period. Nowadays, it is urgent to reduce their consumption in livestock to address the problem of antimicrobial resistance. In this study, the effect of a product on piglet microbiota has been investigated as an alternative to antimicrobials. Three groups of ten post-weaning pigs were sampled at 0, 15 and 30 days one week post-weaning; the control, antibiotic and feed additive group received a standard post-weaning diet without antibiotics or additives, the same diet as the control group but with amoxicillin and colistin sulphate and the same diet as the control group but with a feed additive (Sanacore-EN, Nutriad International N.V.), respectively. The total DNA extracted from faeces was used to amplify the 16S RNA gene for massive sequencing under manufacturer's conditions. Sequencing data was quality filtered and analyzed using QIIME software and suitable statistical methods. In general terms, age modifies significantly the microbiota of the piglets. Thus, the oldest the animal, the highest bacterial diversity observed for the control and the feed additive groups. However, this diversity was very similar in the antibiotic group throughout the trial. Interestingly, a clear increase in abundance of Bacillus and Lactobacillus spp was detected within the feed additive group versus the antibiotic and control groups. In conclusion, the feed additive group had a positive effect in the endogenous microbiota of post-weaning pigs increasing both, the diversity of bacterial families and the abundance of lactic acid bacteria during the post-weaning period.",[],PloS one,"10.1371/journal.pone.0197353

29460487,Hungin et al.,Systematic review: probiotics in the management of lower gastrointestinal symptoms - an updated evidence-based international consensus.,"In 2013, a systematic review and Delphi consensus reported that specific probiotics can benefit adult patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other gastrointestinal (GI) problems.
To update the consensus with new evidence.
A systematic review identified randomised, placebo-controlled trials published between January 2012 and June 2017. Evidence was graded, previously developed statements were reassessed by an 8-expert panel, and agreement was reached via Delphi consensus.
A total of 70 studies were included (IBS, 34; diarrhoea associated with antibiotics, 13; diarrhoea associated with Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy, 7; other conditions, 16). Of 15 studies that examined global IBS symptoms as a primary endpoint, 8 reported significant benefits of probiotics vs placebo. Consensus statements with 100% agreement and ""high"" evidence level indicated that specific probiotics help reduce overall symptom burden and abdominal pain in some patients with IBS and duration/intensity of diarrhoea in patients prescribed antibiotics or H. pylori eradication therapy, and have favourable safety. Statements with 70%-100% agreement and ""moderate"" evidence indicated that, in some patients with IBS, specific probiotics help reduce bloating/distension and improve bowel movement frequency/consistency.
This updated review indicates that specific probiotics are beneficial in certain lower GI problems, although many of the new publications did not report benefits of probiotics, possibly due to inclusion of new, less efficacious preparations. Specific probiotics can relieve lower GI symptoms in IBS, prevent diarrhoea associated with antibiotics and H. pylori eradication therapy, and show favourable safety. This study will help clinicians recommend/prescribe probiotics for specific symptoms.",[],Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,"10.1111/apt.14539

29267517,Braga et al.,What do Cochrane systematic reviews say about probiotics as preventive interventions?,"Probiotics have been used for a range of clinical situations and their use is strongly encouraged by the media worldwide. This study identified and summarized all Cochrane systematic reviews about the preventive effects of probiotics in clinical practice.
Review of systematic reviews, conducted in the Discipline of Evidence-Based Medicine, Escola Paulista de Medicina (EPM), Universidade Federal de São Paulo (Unifesp).
We included all Cochrane reviews on any probiotics when they were used as preventive interventions and compared with no intervention, placebo or any other pharmacological or non-pharmacological intervention.
17 Cochrane systematic reviews fulfilled our inclusion criteria and were summarized in this report. None of the reviews included in the present study provided high-quality evidence for any outcome. The benefits from use of probiotics included decreased incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea; decreased incidence of upper respiratory tract infections and duration of episodes; decreased need for antibiotics and absences from school due to colds; and decreased incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Probiotics seem to decrease the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus, birthweight, risk of vaginal infection and incidence of eczema.
Despite the marketing and the benefits associated with probiotics, there is little scientific evidence supporting the use of probiotics. None of the reviews provided any high-quality evidence for prevention of illnesses through use of probiotics. More trials are needed to gain better knowledge of probiotics and to confirm when their use is beneficial and cost-effective.",[],Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina,10.1590/1516-3180.2017.0310241017,2017-12-22,"[{'lastname': 'Braga', 'firstname': 'Vinícius Lopes', 'initials': 'VL', 'affiliation': 'Undergraduate Medical Student, Escola Paulista de Medicina (EPM), Universidade Federal de São Paulo (Unifesp), São Paulo (SP), Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Rocha', 'firstname': 'Luana Pompeu Dos Santos', 'initials': 'LPDS', 'affiliation': 'Undergraduate Medical Students, Escola Paulista de Medicina (EPM), Universidade Federal de São Paulo (Unifesp), São Paulo (SP), Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Bernardo', 'firstname': 'Daniel Damasceno', 'initials': 'DD', 'affiliation': 'Undergraduate Medical Students, Escola Paulista de Medicina (EPM), Universidade Federal de São Paulo (Unifesp), São Paulo (SP), Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Cruz', 'firstname': 'Carolina de Oliveira', 'initials': 'CO', 'affiliation': 'MD, MSc.

29257353,Goldenberg et al.,Probiotics for the prevention of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea in adults and children.,"Antibiotics can disturb gastrointestinal microbiota which may lead to reduced resistance to pathogens such as Clostridium difficile (C. difficile). Probiotics are live microbial preparations that, when administered in adequate amounts, may confer a health benefit to the host, and are a potential C. difficile prevention strategy. Recent clinical practice guidelines do not recommend probiotic prophylaxis, even though probiotics have the highest quality evidence among cited prophylactic therapies.
To assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics for preventing C.difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) in adults and children.
We searched PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register from inception to 21 March 2017. Additionally, we conducted an extensive grey literature search.
Randomized controlled (placebo, alternative prophylaxis, or no treatment control) trials investigating probiotics (any strain, any dose) for prevention of CDAD, or C. difficile infection were considered for inclusion.
Two authors (independently and in duplicate) extracted data and assessed risk of bias. The primary outcome was the incidence of CDAD. Secondary outcomes included detection of C. difficile infection in stool, adverse events, antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and length of hospital stay. Dichotomous outcomes (e.g. incidence of CDAD) were pooled using a random-effects model to calculate the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). We calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) where appropriate. Continuous outcomes (e.g. length of hospital stay) were pooled using a random-effects model to calculate the mean difference and corresponding 95% CI. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of missing data on efficacy and safety outcomes. For the sensitivity analyses, we assumed that the event rate for those participants in the control group who had missing data was the same as the event rate for those participants in the control group who were successfully followed. For the probiotic group, we calculated effects using the following assumed ratios of event rates in those with missing data in comparison to those successfully followed: 1.5:1, 2:1, 3:1, and 5:1. To explore possible explanations for heterogeneity, a priori subgroup analyses were conducted on probiotic species, dose, adult versus pediatric population, and risk of bias as well as a post hoc subgroup analysis on baseline risk of CDAD (low 0% to 2%; moderate 3% to 5%; high > 5%). The overall quality of the evidence supporting each outcome was independently assessed using the GRADE criteria.
Thirty-nine studies (9955 participants) met the eligibility requirements for our review. Overall, 27 studies were rated as either high or unclear risk of bias. A complete case analysis (i.e. participants who completed the study) among trials investigating CDAD (31 trials, 8672 participants) suggests that probiotics reduce the risk of CDAD by 60%. The incidence of CDAD was 1.5% (70/4525) in the probiotic group compared to 4.0% (164/4147) in the placebo or no treatment control group (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.52; GRADE = moderate). Twenty-two of 31 trials had missing CDAD data ranging from 2% to 45%. Our complete case CDAD results proved robust to sensitivity analyses of plausible and worst-plausible assumptions regarding missing outcome data and results were similar whether considering subgroups of trials in adults versus children, inpatients versus outpatients, different probiotic species, lower versus higher doses of probiotics, or studies at high versus low risk of bias. However, in a post hoc analysis, we did observe a subgroup effect with respect to baseline risk of developing CDAD. Trials with a baseline CDAD risk of 0% to 2% and 3% to 5% did not show any difference in risk but trials enrolling participants with a baseline risk of > 5% for developing CDAD demonstrated a large 70% risk reduction (interaction P value = 0.01). Among studies with a baseline risk > 5%, the incidence of CDAD in the probiotic group was 3.1% (43/1370) compared to 11.6% (126/1084) in the control group (13 trials, 2454 participants; RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.42; GRADE = moderate). With respect to detection of C. difficile in the stool pooled complete case results from 15 trials (1214 participants) did not show a reduction in infection rates. C. difficile infection was 15.5% (98/633) in the probiotics group compared to 17.0% (99/581) in the placebo or no treatment control group (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.10; GRADE = moderate). Adverse events were assessed in 32 studies (8305 participants) and our pooled complete case analysis indicates probiotics reduce the risk of adverse events by 17% (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.97; GRADE = very low). In both treatment and control groups the most common adverse events included abdominal cramping, nausea, fever, soft stools, flatulence, and taste disturbance.
Based on this systematic review and meta-analysis of 31 randomized controlled trials including 8672 patients, moderate certainty evidence suggests that probiotics are effective for preventing CDAD (NNTB = 42 patients, 95% CI 32 to 58). Our post hoc subgroup analyses to explore heterogeneity indicated that probiotics are effective among trials with a CDAD baseline risk >5% (NNTB = 12; moderate certainty evidence), but not among trials with a baseline risk ≤5% (low to moderate certainty evidence). Although adverse effects were reported among 32 included trials, there were more adverse events among patients in the control groups. The short-term use of probiotics appears to be safe and effective when used along with antibiotics in patients who are not immunocompromised or severely debilitated. Despite the need for further research, hospitalized patients, particularly those at high risk of CDAD, should be informed of the potential benefits and harms of probiotics.",[],The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"10.1002/14651858.CD006095.pub4

28871492,Esposito et al.,Frequency of Antibiotic-Associated Diarrhea and Related Complications in Pediatric Patients Who Underwent Hypospadias Repair: a Comparative Study Using Probiotics vs Placebo.,"This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of probiotics (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG), as a preventive measure of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) in children who underwent hypospadias repair and its clinical consequences on postoperative outcome, comparing the group treated with probiotics + antibiotics with two control groups (only antibiotics and antibiotics + placebo). We performed a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study with three groups of patients (30 boys for each group) who underwent hypospadias repair in our unit from March 2016 to December 2016. G1 received antibiotics + probiotics (L. rhamnosus GG), while G2 and G3 respectively received only antibiotics or antibiotics + placebo (glucose solution at 5%) for the same period. The patients were evaluated in regard to the number of evacuations/day, stool consistency, and the number of dressings/day. The overall incidence of postoperative AAD was 33.3% (30/90), and it was statistically lower in G1 patients compared to G2 and G3 ones (p = 0.002). The duration of AAD was significantly longer in G2 and G3 compared to G1 (p = 0.001). In G1, the frequency of dressing change was significantly lower compared to G2 and G3 (p = 0.001).The incidence of postoperative complications (fistula and dehiscence) was significantly higher in G2 and G3 compared to G1 (p = 0.001). Our study confirmed that the use of probiotic L. rhamnosus GG associated with antibiotics significantly reduced the incidence and the duration of postoperative AAD. In addition, the use of probiotics LGG reduced the frequency of dressing changes and the incidence of postoperative complications, such as urethral fistula and foreskin dehiscence.","['Antibiotics', 'Children', 'Diarrhea', 'Hypospadias', 'Placebo', 'Probiotics']",Probiotics and antimicrobial proteins,10.1007/s12602-017-9324-4,2017-09-06,"[{'lastname': 'Esposito', 'firstname': 'Ciro', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Pediatric Surgery Unit, Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Federico II University of Naples, Via Pansini 5, 80131, Naples, Italy. ciroespo@unina.it.'}, {'lastname': 'Roberti', 'firstname': 'Agnese', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Pediatric Surgery Unit, Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Federico II University of Naples, Via Pansini 5, 80131, Naples, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Turrà', 'firstname': 'Francesco', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Pediatric Surgery Unit, Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Federico II University of Naples, Via Pansini 5, 80131, Naples, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Cerulo', 'firstname': 'Mariapina', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Pediatric Surgery Unit, Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Federico II University of Naples, Via Pansini 5, 80131, Naples, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Severino', 'firstname': 'Giovanni', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Pediatric Surgery Unit, Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Federico II University of Naples, Via Pansini 5, 80131, Naples, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Settimi', 'firstname': 'Alessandro', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Pediatric Surgery Unit, Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Federico II University of Naples, Via Pansini 5, 80131, Naples, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Escolino', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Pediatric Surgery Unit, Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Federico II University of Naples, Via Pansini 5, 80131, Naples, Italy.'}]","28871492

We performed a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group study in children receiving outpatient antibiotic therapy in primary healthcare settings. The children were given LP299V/placebo during the antibiotic therapy and for 1 week after the end of treatment. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of at least 1 loose/watery stool (type 6 or 7 according to the Bristol Stool Form Scale). Gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, abdominal distention, vomiting, and flatulence) were followed up until 1 week after the last intake of the study product.
A total of 438 children (male: 235, female: 203) aged 1-11 years (mean ± SD: 5.2 ± 2.7) were randomized to receive LP299V (N = 218) or placebo (N = 220). The incidence of loose/watery stools in the 2 study groups (LP299V and placebo) was similar, 39% vs 44.5% respectively (P = .26) as was the mean number of loose/watery stools (3.9 ± 3.5 vs 4.7 ± 6.3; P = .9). Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (defined as ≥3 loose/watery stools/24 hours starting from 2 hours after initiation of antibiotic treatment until the end of the study) occurred in 2.8% of the subjects receiving LP299V compared with 4.1% in the placebo arm (P = .4). The number of children with abdominal symptoms did not differ between the groups.
No beneficial effect of LP299V compared with placebo was observed for the incidence of loose/watery stools, mean number of loose/watery stools, or the incidence of abdominal symptoms. LP299V had a satisfactory safety profile.

28066944,Wang et al.,"The Effect of Lactobacillus isolates on growth performance, immune response, intestinal bacterial community composition of growing Rex Rabbits.","The objective of this experiment was to investigate the effect of Lactobacillus isolates on intestinal bacterial community composition of growing Rex Rabbits. A total of 120 weaned Rex Rabbits (30 days old, 30 per group) were used for the experiment, which started after an adaptation period of 7 days. The control group was fed with basal diet only, while the treatment I, II and III groups were fed with basal diet adding antibiotics, Lactobacillus zeae (LB1) and Lactobacillus casei (L3) respectively. Growth performance, immune response and intestinal flora have been examined. The results obtained were as follows: (i) F/G of the rabbits fed with Lactobacillus isolates was significantly lower than that of the control group (p < 0.05). (ii) The concentration of ALT decreased significantly (p < 0.05) and that of IgG and IgM increased significantly (p < 0.05) after feeding rabbits with Lactobacillus isolates. (iii) Lactobacillus isolates had no influence on the number of mast cells in duodenum and jejunum, but increased the number of mast cells in caecum significantly (p < 0.05). (iv) The data from pyrosequencing-based analysis suggested that the bacterial community in the rabbit's intestinal flora can be changed by Lactobacillus isolates and antibiotics, especially for the microbial diversity and abundance in the caecum. In conclusion, the application of proper Lactobacillus isolates can improve the growth performance, enhance the immunological function and adjust the intestinal micro-ecosystem of growing Rex Rabbits.","['Lactobacillus', 'antibiotics', 'intestinal flora', 'rabbit']",Journal of animal physiology and animal nutrition,10.1111/jpn.12629,2017-01-10,"[{'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Animal Science, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, Shandong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhu', 'firstname': 'Y', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Animal Science, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, Shandong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Animal Science, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, Shandong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Animal Science, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, Shandong, China.'}]",28066944,92c5771b-8f73-4790-8fb2-3f35f492d0fe,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""J Anim Physiol Anim Nutr (Berl)"""

Probiotics for the prevention of pediatric antibiotic-associated diarrhea.Cochrane Database Syst Rev2015, Issue 12. Art. No.: CD004827. http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD004827.pub4.
Antibiotics are frequently prescribed in children. They alter the microbial balance within the gastrointestinal tract, commonly resulting in antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Probiotics may prevent AAD via restoration of the gut microflora.
The primary objectives were to assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics (any specified strain or dose) used for the prevention of AAD in children.
MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, AMED, and the Web of Science (inception to November 2014) were searched along with specialized registers including the Cochrane IBD/FBD review group, CISCOM (Centralized Information Service for Complementary Medicine), NHS Evidence, the International Bibliographic Information on Dietary Supplements, as well as trial registries. Letters were sent to authors of included trials, nutraceutical and pharmaceutical companies, and experts in the field requesting additional information on ongoing or unpublished trials. Conference proceedings, dissertation abstracts, and reference lists from included and relevant articles were also searched.
Randomized, parallel, controlled trials in children (0-18 years) receiving antibiotics, that compare probiotics to placebo, active alternative prophylaxis, or no treatment and measure the incidence of diarrhea secondary to antibiotic use were considered for inclusion.
Study selection, data extraction, and methodological quality assessment using the risk of bias instrument were conducted independently and in duplicate by two authors. Dichotomous data (incidence of diarrhea and adverse events) were combined using a pooled risk ratio (RR) or risk difference (RD), and continuous data (mean duration of diarrhea and mean daily stool frequency) as mean difference (MD), along with their corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). For overall pooled results on the incidence of diarrhea, sensitivity analyses included available case versus extreme-plausible analyses and random- versus fixed-effect models. To explore possible explanations for heterogeneity, a priori subgroup analysis was conducted on probiotic strain, dose, definition of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and risk of bias. We also conducted post hoc subgroup analyses by patient diagnosis, single versus multi-strain, industry sponsorship, and inpatient status. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE criteria.
Overall, 23 studies (3938 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Trials included treatment with either Bacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Clostridium butyricum, Lactobacilli spp., Lactococcus spp., Leuconostoc cremoris, Saccharomyces spp., or Streptococcus spp., alone or in combination. Eleven studies used a single-strain probiotic, four combined two probiotic strains, three combined three probiotic strains, one combined four probiotic strains, two combined seven probiotic strains, one included ten probiotic strains, and one study included two probiotic arms that used three and two strains, respectively. The risk of bias was determined to be high or unclear in 13 studies and low in 10 studies. Available case (patients who did not complete the studies were not included in the analysis) results from 22/23 trials reporting on the incidence of diarrhea show a precise benefit from probiotics compared to active, placebo, or no treatment control. The incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% (163/1992) compared to 19% (364/1906) in the control group (RR = 0.46; 95% CI: 0.35-0.61; I2 = 55%, 3898 participants). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was moderate. This benefit remained statistically significant in an extreme-plausible (60% of children lost to follow-up in probiotic group and 20% lost to follow-up in the control group had diarrhea) sensitivity analysis, where the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 14% (330/2294) compared to 19% (426/2235) in the control group (RR = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.54-0.89; I2 = 63%, 4529 participants). None of the 16 trials (n = 2455) that reported on adverse events documented any serious adverse events attributable to probiotics. Meta-analysis excluded all but an extremely small non-significant difference in adverse events between treatment and control (RD = 0.00, 95% CI: -0.01 to 0.01). The majority of adverse events were in placebo, standard care, or no treatment group. Adverse events reported in the studies include rash, nausea, gas, flatulence, abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, vomiting, increased phlegm, chest pain, constipation, taste disturbance, and low appetite. AUTHORS׳ CONCLUSIONS: Moderate quality evidence suggests a protective effect of probiotics in preventing AAD. Our pooled estimate suggests a precise (RR 0.46; 95% CI: 0.35-0.61) probiotic effect with an NNT of 10. Among the various probiotics evaluated, Lactobacillus rhamnosus or Saccharomyces boulardii at 5-40 billion colony-forming units/day may be appropriate given the modest NNT and the likelihood that adverse events are very rare. It is premature to draw conclusions about the efficacy and safety of other probiotic agents for pediatric AAD. Although no serious adverse events were observed among otherwise healthy children, serious adverse events have been observed in severely debilitated or immunocompromised children with underlying risk factors including central venous catheter use and disorders associated with bacterial/fungal translocation. Until further research has been conducted, probiotic use should be avoided in pediatric populations at risk for adverse events. Future trials would benefit from a standard and valid outcomes to measure AAD.",[],"Explore (New York, N.Y.)",10.1016/j.explore.2016.08.015,2016-10-01,"[{'lastname': 'Hayes', 'firstname': 'Shelby R', 'initials': 'SR', 'affiliation': 'National Cancer Institute, 6100 Executive Bldv, Rockville, MD 20852.'}, {'lastname': 'Vargas', 'firstname': 'Ashley J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': 'National Cancer Institute, 6100 Executive Bldv, Rockville, MD 20852.

27621567,Gallo et al.,Modulation of microbiota as treatment for intestinal inflammatory disorders: An uptodate.,"Alterations of intestinal microflora may significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of different inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. There is emerging interest on the role of selective modulation of microflora in inducing benefits in inflammatory intestinal disorders, by as probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, antibiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). To summarize recent evidences on microflora modulation in main intestinal inflammatory disorders, PubMed was searched using terms microbiota, intestinal flora, probiotics, prebiotics, fecal transplantation. More than three hundred articles published up to 2015 were selected and reviewed. Randomized placebo-controlled trials and meta-analysis were firstly included, mainly for probiotics. A meta-analysis was not performed because of the heterogeneity of these studies. Most of relevant data derived from studies on probiotics, reporting some efficacy in ulcerative colitis and in pouchitis, while disappointing results are available for Crohn's disease. Probiotic supplementation may significantly reduce rates of rotavirus diarrhea. Efficacy of probiotics in NSAID enteropathy and irritable bowel syndrome is still controversial. Finally, FMT has been recently recognized as an efficacious treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection. Modulation of intestinal flora represents a very interesting therapeutic target, although it still deserves some doubts and limitations. Future studies should be encouraged to provide new understanding about its therapeutical role.","['Gut', 'Inflammation', 'Microbiota', 'Prebiotic', 'Probiotic']",World journal of gastroenterology,10.3748/wjg.v22.i32.7186,2016-09-14,"[{'lastname': 'Gallo', 'firstname': 'Antonella', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Antonella Gallo, Giovanna Passaro, Raffaele Landolfi, Massimo Montalto, Institute of Internal Medicine, Fondazione Policlinico ""Agostino Gemelli"", Catholic University of Sacred Heart, 00168 Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Passaro', 'firstname': 'Giovanna', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Antonella Gallo, Giovanna Passaro, Raffaele Landolfi, Massimo Montalto, Institute of Internal Medicine, Fondazione Policlinico ""Agostino Gemelli"", Catholic University of Sacred Heart, 00168 Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Gasbarrini', 'firstname': 'Antonio', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Antonella Gallo, Giovanna Passaro, Raffaele Landolfi, Massimo Montalto, Institute of Internal Medicine, Fondazione Policlinico ""Agostino Gemelli"", Catholic University of Sacred Heart, 00168 Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Landolfi', 'firstname': 'Raffaele', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Antonella Gallo, Giovanna Passaro, Raffaele Landolfi, Massimo Montalto, Institute of Internal Medicine, Fondazione Policlinico ""Agostino Gemelli"", Catholic University of Sacred Heart, 00168 Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Montalto', 'firstname': 'Massimo', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Antonella Gallo, Giovanna Passaro, Raffaele Landolfi, Massimo Montalto, Institute of Internal Medicine, Fondazione Policlinico ""Agostino Gemelli"", Catholic University of Sacred Heart, 00168 Rome, Italy.'}]","27621567

27530282,Sharif et al.,The Effect of a Yeast Probiotic on Acute Diarrhea in Children.,"A probiotic is a living micro-organism administered to promote the health of the host by treating or preventing infections owing to strains of pathogens. Saccharomyces boulardii is a nonpathogen yeast that has a direct inhibitory effect on the growth of many pathogens, an anti-secretory effect and a trophic effect on enterocytes. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of S. boulardii on diarrhea in children. The children from 6 months to 6 years of age with acute watery diarrhea admitted in pediatric clinic in Kashan in 2012 were included in this trial. Exclusion criteria were high fever (T > 38.5 °C), severe dehydration, bloody diarrhea, severe malnutrition, using of antibiotics, anti-diarrheal or antifungal drugs and children with more than one complain. Two hundred patients were assigned into two groups: A total of 100 patients were treated with S. boulardii in addition to ORS (case group) and 100 patients were given placebo in addition to ORS (control group). The duration of diarrhea and frequency of stools were recorded by asking the mothers of the children every day. The results showed that the defecation frequency after second day of treatment in the case group was significantly less than the control group (P = 0.001) and the mean numbers of days of diarrhea was significantly lower in the case group (P = 0.001). The result of this study confirms that S. boulardii reduces the frequency of stool and duration of illness in children.","['Acute diarrhea', 'Children', 'Probiotic', 'Saccharomyces boulardii', 'Yeast']",Probiotics and antimicrobial proteins,10.1007/s12602-016-9221-2,2016-08-18,"[{'lastname': 'Sharif', 'firstname': 'Mohammad Reza', 'initials': 'MR', 'affiliation': 'Infectious Diseases Research Center, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Kashani', 'firstname': 'Hamed Haddad', 'initials': 'HH', 'affiliation': 'Anatomical Sciences Research Center, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Ardakani', 'firstname': 'Abbas Taghavi', 'initials': 'AT', 'affiliation': 'Infectious Diseases Research Center, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Kheirkhah', 'firstname': 'Davood', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Infectious Diseases Research Center, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Tabatabaei', 'firstname': 'Fatemeh', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Endocrine and Metabolism Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Sharif', 'firstname': 'Alireza', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Infectious Diseases Research Center, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran.

27169634,Evans et al.,"Effectiveness of Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactobacillus rhamnosus for the management of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in healthy adults: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.","Broad-spectrum antibiotic use can disrupt the gastrointestinal microbiota resulting in diarrhoea. Probiotics may be beneficial in managing this type of diarrhoea. The aim of this 10-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study was to investigate the effect of Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus R0011 supplementation on antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in healthy adults. Subjects were randomised to receive 1 week of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (875 mg/125 mg) once per day, plus a daily dose of 8×109 colony-forming units of a multi-strain probiotic (n 80) or placebo (n 80). The probiotic or placebo intervention was maintained for 1 week after completion of the antibiotic. Primary study outcomes of consistency and frequency of bowel movements were not significantly different between the probiotic and placebo groups. The secondary outcomes of diarrhoea-like defecations, Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale scores, safety parameters and adverse events were not significantly different between the probiotic intervention and the placebo. A post hoc analysis on the duration of diarrhoea-like defecations showed that probiotic intervention reduced the length of these events by 1 full day (probiotic, 2·70 (sem 0·36) d; placebo, 3·71 (sem 0·36) d; P=0·037; effect size=0·52). In conclusion, this study provides novel evidence that L. helveticus R0052 and L. rhamnosus R0011 supplementation significantly reduced the duration of diarrhoea-like defecations in healthy adults receiving antibiotics.","['AAD antibiotic-associated diarrhoea', 'Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea', 'BSS Bristol Stool Scale', 'CFU colony-forming units', 'DBHD daily bowel habits diary', 'DLD diarrhoea-like defecations', 'Diarrhoea-like defecation', 'GSRS Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale', 'Lactobacillus helveticus', 'Lactobacillus rhamnosus', 'Probiotics']",The British journal of nutrition,10.1017/S0007114516001665,2016-05-14,"[{'lastname': 'Evans', 'firstname': 'Malkanthi', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': '1KGK Synergize Inc.,London,ON,Canada, N6A 5R8.'}, {'lastname': 'Salewski', 'firstname': 'Ryan P', 'initials': 'RP', 'affiliation': '1KGK Synergize Inc.,London,ON,Canada, N6A 5R8.'}, {'lastname': 'Christman', 'firstname': 'Mary C', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': '2MCC Statistical Consulting,Gainesville,FL 32605,USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Girard', 'firstname': 'Stephanie-Anne', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': '3Lallemand Health Solutions,Montreal,QC,Canada, H4P 2R2.'}, {'lastname': 'Tompkins', 'firstname': 'Thomas A', 'initials': 'TA', 'affiliation': '3Lallemand Health Solutions,Montreal,QC,Canada, H4P 2R2.'}]",27169634,92c5771b-8f73-4790-8fb2-3f35f492d0fe,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Br J Nutr"""
27130655,Jafarnejad et al.,Probiotics Reduce the Risk of Antibiotic-Associated Diarrhea in Adults (18-64 Years) but Not the Elderly (>65 Years): A Meta-Analysis.,"Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is a common problem in adults and elderly patients due to the widespread use of antibiotics in this population. Multiple previous systematic reviews have demonstrated an association between specific probiotics and decrease of AAD, especially in children. As there is no specific analysis concerning the elderly patients, we decided to focus on adults, especially elderly people.
We performed a systematic review of the literature regarding the use of probiotics in the treatment of AAD in adults (18-64 years old) and elderly subjects (≥65 years old). We identified 436 articles that met the search criteria. Thirty randomized controlled trials met the predefined inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis.
There was considerable heterogeneity among the trials (P < .001); thus, subgroup analyses were performed. The meta-analysis resulted in a pooled relative risk (RR) of AAD of 0.69 (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.62-0.76) in a fixed effects model and 0.58 (95% CI: 0.48-0.71) in a random effects model, as compared with placebo. The positive association between intake of probiotic and reduced risk of AAD was observed in adults (RR, 0.47; 95% CI: 0.4-0.56). In contrast, in elderly patients, there was no positive effect (RR, 0.94; 95% CI: 0.76-1.15) of probiotic use and AAD.
In summary, the results emerging from our meta-analysis suggested that adjunct probiotic administration is associated with a reduced risk of AAD in adults but not in elderly people.","['adults', 'aged', 'antibiotic-associated diarrhea', 'diarrhea', 'elderly', 'probiotics']",Nutrition in clinical practice : official publication of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition,10.1177/0884533616639399,2016-05-01,"[{'lastname': 'Jafarnejad', 'firstname': 'Sadegh', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Nutrition, School of Nutritional Sciences and Dietetics, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Shab-Bidar', 'firstname': 'Sakineh', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Community Nutrition, School of Nutritional Sciences and Dietetics, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Speakman', 'firstname': 'John R', 'initials': 'JR', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Biological and Environmental Sciences, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, Scotland.'}, {'lastname': 'Parastui', 'firstname': 'Karim', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Nutrition, School of Nutritional Sciences and Dietetics, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Daneshi-Maskooni', 'firstname': 'Milad', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Community Nutrition, School of Nutritional Sciences and Dietetics, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Djafarian', 'firstname': 'Kurosh', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Nutrition, School of Nutritional Sciences and Dietetics, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran kdjafarian@tums.ac.ir.'}]",27130655,92c5771b-8f73-4790-8fb2-3f35f492d0fe,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Nutr Clin Pract"""

This secondary analysis from a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study examined whether three different probiotics could normalise self-reported stress-associated GI discomfort and reduce overall self-reported stress. Undergraduate students (n=581) received Lactobacillus helveticus R0052, Bifidobacterium longum ssp. infantis R0033, Bifidobacterium bifidum R0071, or placebo. Participants self-reported 2 outcomes for a 6-week period, which included final academic exams: daily level of stress (0=no stress to 10=extremely stressed) and weekly three diarrhoea-related symptoms (DS, 1=no discomfort to 7=severe discomfort) using the GI Symptom Rating Scale. Self-reported stress was positively related to DS (P=0.0068). Mean DS scores were lower with B. bifidum versus placebo at week 2 at the average level of stress and the average body mass index (BMI). DS scores were lower with B. bifidum at week 5 versus week 0 and 1 and with B. infantis R0033 at week 6 versus week 0. DS scores were higher when antibiotics were used in the prior week with placebo (P=0.0092). DS were not different with or without antibiotic use with the probiotics. Only B. bifidum had an effect on self-reported stress scores (P=0.0086). The self-reported stress score was also dependent on hours of sleep per day where it decreased by 0.13 for each additional hour of sleep.

26695080,Goldenberg et al.,Probiotics for the prevention of pediatric antibiotic-associated diarrhea.,"Antibiotics are frequently prescribed in children. They alter the microbial balance within the gastrointestinal tract, commonly resulting in antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Probiotics may prevent AAD via restoration of the gut microflora.
The primary objectives were to assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics (any specified strain or dose) used for the prevention of AAD in children.
MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, AMED, and the Web of Science (inception to November 2014) were searched along with specialized registers including the Cochrane IBD/FBD review group, CISCOM (Centralized Information Service for Complementary Medicine), NHS Evidence, the International Bibliographic Information on Dietary Supplements as well as trial registries. Letters were sent to authors of included trials, nutraceutical and pharmaceutical companies, and experts in the field requesting additional information on ongoing or unpublished trials. Conference proceedings, dissertation abstracts, and reference lists from included and relevant articles were also searched.
Randomized, parallel, controlled trials in children (0 to 18 years) receiving antibiotics, that compare probiotics to placebo, active alternative prophylaxis, or no treatment and measure the incidence of diarrhea secondary to antibiotic use were considered for inclusion.
Study selection, data extraction as well as methodological quality assessment using the risk of bias instrument was conducted independently and in duplicate by two authors. Dichotomous data (incidence of diarrhea, adverse events) were combined using a pooled risk ratio (RR) or risk difference (RD), and continuous data (mean duration of diarrhea, mean daily stool frequency) as mean difference (MD), along with their corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). For overall pooled results on the incidence of diarrhea, sensitivity analyses included available case versus extreme-plausible analyses and random- versus fixed-effect models. To explore possible explanations for heterogeneity, a priori subgroup analysis were conducted on probiotic strain, dose, definition of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, as well as risk of bias. We also conducted post hoc subgroup analyses by patient diagnosis, single versus multi-strain, industry sponsorship, and inpatient status. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE criteria.
Twenty-three studies (3938 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Trials included treatment with either Bacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Clostridium butyricum, Lactobacilli spp., Lactococcus spp., Leuconostoc cremoris, Saccharomyces spp., orStreptococcus spp., alone or in combination. Eleven studies used a single strain probiotic, four combined two probiotic strains, three combined three probiotic strains, one combined four probiotic strains, two combined seven probiotic strains, one included ten probiotic strains, and one study included two probiotic arms that used three and two strains respectively. The risk of bias was determined to be high or unclear in 13 studies and low in 10 studies. Available case (patients who did not complete the studies were not included in the analysis) results from 22/23 trials reporting on the incidence of diarrhea show a precise benefit from probiotics compared to active, placebo or no treatment control. The incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% (163/1992) compared to 19% (364/1906) in the control group (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.61; I(2) = 55%, 3898 participants). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was moderate. This benefit remained statistically significant in an extreme plausible (60% of children loss to follow-up in probiotic group and 20% loss to follow-up in the control group had diarrhea) sensitivity analysis, where the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 14% (330/2294) compared to 19% (426/2235) in the control group (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.54 to 0.89; I(2) = 63%, 4529 participants). None of the 16 trials (n = 2455) that reported on adverse events documented any serious adverse events attributable to probiotics. Meta-analysis excluded all but an extremely small non-significant difference in adverse events between treatment and control (RD 0.00; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01). The majority of adverse events were in placebo, standard care or no treatment group. Adverse events reported in the studies include rash, nausea, gas, flatulence, abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, vomiting, increased phlegm, chest pain, constipation, taste disturbance, and low appetite.
Moderate quality evidence suggests a protective effect of probiotics in preventing AAD. Our pooled estimate suggests a precise (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.61) probiotic effect with a NNT of 10. Among the various probiotics evaluated, Lactobacillus rhamnosus or Saccharomyces boulardii at 5 to 40 billion colony forming units/day may be appropriate given the modest NNT and the likelihood that adverse events are very rare. It is premature to draw conclusions about the efficacy and safety of other probiotic agents for pediatric AAD. Although no serious adverse events were observed among otherwise healthy children, serious adverse events have been observed in severely debilitated or immuno-compromised children with underlying risk factors including central venous catheter use and disorders associated with bacterial/fungal translocation. Until further research has been conducted, probiotic use should be avoided in pediatric populations at risk for adverse events.

Due to the small number of cases of diarrhoea, comparisons between groups were made using Fisher's exact analysis.
72 children commenced and 70 children (36 placebo and 34 probiotic) completed the trial. There were no incidents of severe diarrhoea (stool consistency ≥6, ≥3 stools/day for ≥2 consecutive days) in the probiotic group and six in the placebo group (Fisher's exact p=0.025). There was also only one episode of minor diarrhoea (stool consistency ≥5, ≥2 stools/day for ≥2 days in the probiotic group compared to 21 in the placebo group (Fisher's exact p<0.001). The probiotic group reported fewer adverse events (1 had abdominal pain, 1 vomited and 1 had headache) than the placebo group (6 had abdominal pain, 4 had loss of appetite and 1 had nausea).
A yogurt combination of LGG, La-5 and Bb-12 is an effective method for reducing the incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in children.

25579140,Khalighi et al.,Evaluating the efficacy of probiotic on treatment in patients with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)--a pilot study.,"Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) leads to several gastrointestinal (GI) problems and complications leading to malabsorption. The effectiveness of probiotics in the treatment of SIBO syndrome has not been well studied. This pilot study was aimed to assess the efficacy of a probiotic consisting of lactobacilli in the treatment of SIBO.
In this study, 30 cases suffering from chronic abdominal pain or diarrhoea and with a positive hydrogen breath test were randomized in a double-blind manner into two groups: probiotic drug user and control group. After an initial 3-week aggressive therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics, a 15-day maintenance antibiotic therapy with lactol was administered for the study group and the same regimen without lactol for the control group. After six months the HBT result and the GI symptoms were analyzed and compared between the two groups.
The result of hydrogen breath test and the clinical symptoms in patients receiving the maintenance regimen with lactol probiotic showed a better response. The hydrogen breath test turned negative in 93.3 per cent of those receiving lactol compared to 66.7 per cent of the controls. In all the cases receiving lactol, the abdominal pain disappeared completely ( p =0.002). In addition, other GI problems including flatulence, belching and diarrhoea significantly improved in the study group ( p < 0.05).
Based on the preliminary data it seems that adding lactol probiotic to the maintenance therapy of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth patients on routine antibiotic therapy will be beneficial in preventing the complications of this syndrome.",[],The Indian journal of medical research,,2015-01-13,"[{'lastname': 'Khalighi', 'firstname': 'A R', 'initials': 'AR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Quaem Hospital, Mashhad University of Medical Science (MUMS), Mashhad, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Khalighi', 'firstname': 'M R', 'initials': 'MR', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Behdani', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Jamali', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Khosravi', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kouhestani', 'firstname': 'Sh', 'initials': 'Sh', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Radmanesh', 'firstname': 'H', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Esmaeelzadeh', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Khalighi', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}]","25579140

24348885,Pattani et al.,Probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and Clostridium difficile infection among hospitalized patients: systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) are associated with high morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Probiotics may mitigate the existing disease burden. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of co-administration of probiotics with antibiotics in preventing these adverse outcomes in adult inpatients.
Systematic searches of MEDLINE (1946 to May 2012), Embase (1980 to May 2012), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were undertaken on May 31, 2012, to identify relevant publications. We searched for randomized controlled trials, published in English, of adult inpatients who were receiving antibiotics and who were randomly assigned to co-administration of probiotics or usual care, with or without the use of placebo. Studies were included if they reported on AAD or CDI (or both) as outcomes. Data for predetermined criteria evaluating study characteristics, methods, and risk of bias were extracted. Trials were given a global rating of good, fair, or poor by at least 2 reviewers. Meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model, and pooled relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.
Sixteen trials met the criteria for inclusion in this review. Four studies were of good quality, 5 were of fair quality, and 7 were of poor quality. Pooled analyses revealed significant reductions in the risks of AAD (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.79) and CDI (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.61) among patients randomly assigned to co-administration of probiotics. The number needed to treat for benefit was 11 (95% CI 8 to 20) for AAD and 14 (95% CI 9 to 50) for CDI. With subgroup analysis, significant reductions in rates of both AAD and CDI were retained in the subgroups of good-quality trials, the trials assessing a primarily Lactobacillus-based probiotic formulation, and the trials for which the follow-up period was less than 4 weeks.
Probiotics used concurrently with antibiotics reduce the risk of AAD and CDI.",[],"Open medicine : a peer-reviewed, independent, open-access journal","10.1001/archinte.162.19.2177

24309198,Allen et al.,"A high-dose preparation of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in the prevention of antibiotic-associated and Clostridium difficile diarrhoea in older people admitted to hospital: a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel arm trial (PLACIDE).","Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) occurs most commonly in older people admitted to hospital and within 12 weeks of exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics. Although usually a mild and self-limiting illness, the 15-39% of cases caused by Clostridium difficile infection [C. difficile diarrhoea (CDD)] may result in severe diarrhoea and death. Previous research has shown that probiotics, live microbial organisms that, when administered in adequate numbers, are beneficial to health, may be effective in preventing AAD and CDD.
To determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a high-dose, multistrain probiotic in the prevention of AAD and CDD in older people admitted to hospital.
A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm trial.
Medical, surgical and elderly care inpatient wards in five NHS hospitals in the UK.
Eligible patients were aged ≥ 65 years, were exposed to one or more oral or parenteral antibiotics and were without pre-existing diarrhoeal disorders, recent CDD or at risk of probiotic adverse effects. Out of 17,420 patients screened, 2981 (17.1%) were recruited. Participants were allocated sequentially according to a computer-generated random allocation sequence; 1493 (50.1%) were allocated to the probiotic and 1488 (49.9%) to the placebo arm.
Vegetarian capsules containing two strains of lactobacilli and two strains of bifidobacteria (a total of 6 × 10(10) organisms per day) were taken daily for 21 days. The placebo was inert maltodextrin powder in identical capsules.
The occurrence of AAD within 8 weeks and CDD within 12 weeks of recruitment was determined by participant follow-up and checking hospital laboratory records by research nurses who were blind to arm allocation.
Analysis based on the treatment allocated included 2941 (98.7%) participants. Potential risk factors for AAD at baseline were similar in the two study arms. Frequency of AAD (including CDD) was similar in the probiotic (159/1470, 10.8%) and placebo arms [153/1471, 10.4%; relative risk (RR) 1.04; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.28; p = 0.71]. CDD was an uncommon cause of AAD and occurred in 12/1470 (0.8%) participants in the probiotic and 17/1471 (1.2%) in the placebo arm (RR 0.71; 95% CI 0.34 to 1.47; p = 0.35). Duration and severity of diarrhoea, common gastrointestinal symptoms, serious adverse events and quality of life measures were also similar in the two arms. Total health-care costs per patient did not differ significantly between the probiotic (£8020; 95% CI £7620 to £8420) and placebo (£8010; 95% CI £7600 to £8420) arms.
We found no evidence that probiotic administration was effective in preventing AAD. Although there was a trend towards reduced CDD in the probiotic arm, on balance, the administration of this probiotic seems unlikely to benefit older patients exposed to antibiotics. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of AAD and CDD and the strain-specific effects of probiotics is needed before further clinical trials of specific microbial preparations are undertaken. Evaluation of the effectiveness of other probiotics will be difficult where other measures, such as antibiotic stewardship, have reduced CDD rates.

24044687,Wong et al.,A Lactobacillus casei Shirota probiotic drink reduces antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in patients with spinal cord injuries: a randomised controlled trial.,"Certain probiotics may prevent the development of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD), but their effectiveness depends on both strain and dose. There are few data on nutritional interventions to control AAD/CDAD in the spinal cord injury (SCI) population. The present study aimed to assess (1) the efficacy of consuming a commercially produced probiotic containing at least 6·5 × 10⁹ live Lactobacillus casei Shirota (LcS) in reducing the incidence of AAD/CDAD, and (2) whether undernutrition and proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are risk factors for AAD/CDAD. A total of 164 SCI patients (50·1 (sd 17·8) years) with a requirement for antibiotics (median 21 d, range 5-366) were randomly allocated to receive LcS (n 76) or no probiotic (n 82). LcS was given once daily for the duration of the antibiotic course and continued for 7 days thereafter. Nutritional risk was assessed by the Spinal Nutrition Screening Tool. The LcS group had a significantly lower incidence of AAD (17·1 v. 54·9%, P< 0·001). At baseline, 65% of patients were at undernutrition risk. Undernutrition (64·1 v. 33·3%, P< 0·01) and the use of PPI (38·4 v. 12·1 %, P= 0·022) were found to be associated with AAD. However, no significant difference was observed in nutrient intake between the groups. The multivariate logistic regression analysis identified poor appetite ( < 1/2 meals eaten) (OR 5·04, 95% CI 1·28, 19·84) and no probiotic (OR 8·46, 95% CI 3·22, 22·20) as the independent risk factors for AAD. The present study indicated that LcS could reduce the incidence of AAD in hospitalised SCI patients. A randomised, placebo-controlled study is needed to confirm this apparent therapeutic success in order to translate into improved clinical outcomes.",[],The British journal of nutrition,10.1017/S0007114513002973,2013-09-21,"[{'lastname': 'Wong', 'firstname': 'Samford', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'National Spinal Injuries Centre, Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Aylesbury HP21 8AL, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Jamous', 'firstname': 'Ali', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'National Spinal Injuries Centre, Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Aylesbury HP21 8AL, UK.'}, {'lastname': ""O'Driscoll"", 'firstname': 'Jean', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology, Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Aylesbury HP21 8AL, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Sekhar', 'firstname': 'Ravi', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gastroenterology, Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Aylesbury HP21 8AL, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Weldon', 'firstname': 'Mike', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gastroenterology, Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Aylesbury HP21 8AL, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Yau', 'firstname': 'Chi Y', 'initials': 'CY', 'affiliation': 'Medicine for Older People, Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Aylesbury HP21 8AL, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Hirani', 'firstname': 'Shashivadan P', 'initials': 'SP', 'affiliation': 'School of Community and Health Science, City University, London EC1V 0HB, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Grimble', 'firstname': 'George', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Gastroenterology and Clinical Nutrition, University College London, London WC1E 6BT, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Forbes', 'firstname': 'Alastair', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Gastroenterology and Clinical Nutrition, University College London, London WC1E 6BT, UK.'}]",24044687,92c5771b-8f73-4790-8fb2-3f35f492d0fe,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Br J Nutr"""
23981066,Hungin et al.,Systematic review: probiotics in the management of lower gastrointestinal symptoms in clinical practice -- an evidence-based international guide.,"Evidence suggests that the gut microbiota play an important role in gastrointestinal problems.
To give clinicians a practical reference guide on the role of specified probiotics in managing particular lower gastrointestinal symptoms/problems by means of a systematic review-based consensus.
Systematic literature searching identified randomised, placebo-controlled trials in adults; evidence for each symptom/problem was graded and statements developed (consensus process; 10-member panel). As results cannot be generalised between different probiotics, individual probiotics were identified for each statement.
Thirty seven studies were included; mostly on irritable bowel syndrome [IBS; 19 studies; treatment responder rates: 18-80% (specific probiotics), 5-50% (placebo)] or antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD; 10 studies). Statements with 100% agreement and 'high' evidence levels indicated that: (i) specific probiotics help reduce overall symptom burden and abdominal pain in some IBS patients; (ii) in patients receiving antibiotics/Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy, specified probiotics are helpful as adjuvants to prevent/reduce the duration/intensity of AAD; (iii) probiotics have favourable safety in patients in primary care. Items with 70-100% agreement and 'moderate' evidence were: (i) specific probiotics help relieve overall symptom burden in some patients with diarrhoea-predominant IBS, and reduce bloating/distension and improve bowel movement frequency/consistency in some IBS patients and (ii) with some probiotics, improved symptoms have led to improvement in quality of life.
Specified probiotics can provide benefit in IBS and antibiotic-associated diarrhoea; relatively few studies in other indications suggested benefits warranting further research.

23932219,Allen et al.,"Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and Clostridium difficile diarrhoea in older inpatients (PLACIDE): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial.","Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) occurs most frequently in older (≥65 years) inpatients exposed to broad-spectrum antibiotics. When caused by Clostridium difficile, AAD can result in life-threatening illness. Although underlying disease mechanisms are not well understood, microbial preparations have been assessed in the prevention of AAD. However, studies have been mostly small single-centre trials with varying quality, providing insufficient data to reliably assess effectiveness. We aimed to do a pragmatic efficacy trial in older inpatients who would be representative of those admitted to National Health Service (NHS) and similar secondary care institutions and to recruit a sufficient number of patients to generate a definitive result.
We did a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pragmatic, efficacy trial of inpatients aged 65 years and older and exposed to one or more oral or parenteral antibiotics. A computer-generated randomisation scheme was used to allocate participants (in a 1:1 ratio) to receive either a multistrain preparation of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, with a total of 6 × 10(10) organisms, one per day for 21 days, or an identical placebo. Patients, study staff, and specimen and data analysts were masked to assignment. The primary outcomes were occurrence of AAD within 8 weeks and C difficile diarrhoea (CDD) within 12 weeks of recruitment. Analysis was by modified intention-to-treat. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN70017204.
Of 17,420 patients screened, 1493 were randomly assigned to the microbial preparation group and 1488 to the placebo group. 1470 and 1471, respectively, were included in the analyses of the primary endpoints. AAD (including CDD) occurred in 159 (10·8%) participants in the microbial preparation group and 153 (10·4%) participants in the placebo group (relative risk [RR] 1·04; 95% CI 0·84-1·28; p=0·71). CDD was an uncommon cause of AAD and occurred in 12 (0·8%) participants in the microbial preparation group and 17 (1·2%) participants in the placebo group (RR 0·71; 95% CI 0·34-1·47; p=0·35). 578 (19·7%) participants had one or more serious adverse event; the frequency of serious adverse events was much the same in the two study groups and none was attributed to participation in the trial.
We identified no evidence that a multistrain preparation of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria was effective in prevention of AAD or CDD. An improved understanding of the pathophysiology of AAD is needed to guide future studies.

23728658,Goldenberg et al.,Probiotics for the prevention of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea in adults and children.,"Antibiotics are widely prescribed; however they can cause disturbances in gastrointestinal flora which may lead to reduced resistance to pathogens such as Clostridium difficile (C. difficile). Probiotics are live organisms thought to balance the gastrointestinal flora.
The primary objectives were to assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics for preventing Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) or C. difficile infection in adults and children.
On February 21, 2013 we searched PubMed (1966-2013), EMBASE (1966-2013), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 1), CINAHL (1982-2013), AMED (1985-2013), and ISI Web of Science. Additionally, we conducted an extensive grey literature search including contact with industry representatives.
Randomized controlled (placebo, alternative prophylaxis, or no treatment control) trials investigating probiotics (any strain, any dose) for prevention of CDAD, or C. difficile infection were considered for inclusion.
Two authors independently and in duplicate extracted data and assessed risk of bias using pre-constructed, and piloted, data extraction forms. Any disagreements were resolved by a third adjudicator. For articles published in abstract form only, further information was sought by contacting principal authors. The primary outcome was the incidence of CDAD. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of C. difficile infection, adverse events, antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and length of hospital stay. Dichotomous outcomes (e.g. incidence of CDAD) were pooled using a random-effects model to calculate the relative risk and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Continuous outcomes (e.g. length of hospital) were pooled using a random-effects model to calculate the mean difference and corresponding 95% CI. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of missing data on efficacy and safety outcomes. For the sensitivity analyses, we assumed that the event rate for those participants in the control group who had missing data was the same as the event rate for those participants in the control group who were successfully followed. For the probiotic group we calculated effects using the following assumed ratios of event rates in those with missing data in comparison to those successfully followed: 1.5:1, 2:1, 3:1, and 5:1. To explore possible explanations for heterogeneity, a priori subgroup analysis were conducted on probiotic species, dose, adult versus pediatric population, and risk of bias.The overall quality of the evidence supporting each outcome was assessed using the GRADE criteria.
A total of 1871 studies were identified with 31 (4492 participants) meeting eligibility requirements for our review. Overall 11 studies were rated as a high risk of bias due mostly to missing outcome data. A complete case analysis (i.e. participants who completed the study) of those trials investigating CDAD (23 trials, 4213 participants) suggests that probiotics significantly reduce this risk by 64%. The incidence of CDAD was 2.0% in the probiotic group compared to 5.5% in the placebo or no treatment control group (RR 0.36; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.51). Sixteen of 23 trials had missing CDAD data ranging from 5% to 45%. These results proved robust to sensitivity analyses of plausible and worst-plausible assumptions regarding missing outcome data and were similar whether considering trials in adults versus children, lower versus higher doses, different probiotic species, or higher versus lower risk of bias. Our judgment is that the overall evidence warrants moderate confidence in this large relative risk reduction. We downgraded the overall quality of evidence for CDAD to 'moderate' due to imprecision. There were few events (154) and the calculated optimal information size (n = 8218) was more than the total sample size. With respect to the incidence of C. difficile infection, a secondary outcome, pooled complete case results from 13 trials (961 participants) did not show a statistically significant reduction. The incidence of C. difficile infection was 12.6% in the probiotics group compared to 12.7% in the placebo or no treatment control group (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.24). Adverse events were assessed in 26 studies (3964 participants) and our pooled complete case analysis indicates probiotics reduce the risk of adverse events by 20% (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.68 to 0.95). In both treatment and control groups the most common adverse events included abdominal cramping, nausea, fever, soft stools, flatulence, and taste disturbance. For the short-term use of probiotics in patients that are not immunocompromised or severely debilitated, we consider the strength of this evidence to be moderate.
Based on this systematic review and meta-analysis of 23 randomized controlled trials including 4213 patients, moderate quality evidence suggests that probiotics are both safe and effective for preventing Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea.",[],The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,10.1002/14651858.CD006095.pub3,2013-06-04,"[{'lastname': 'Goldenberg', 'firstname': 'Joshua Z', 'initials': 'JZ', 'affiliation': 'Bastyr University, Seattle, WA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ma', 'firstname': 'Stephanie S Y', 'initials': 'SS', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Saxton', 'firstname': 'Jane D', 'initials': 'JD', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Martzen', 'firstname': 'Mark R', 'initials': 'MR', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Vandvik', 'firstname': 'Per O', 'initials': 'PO', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Thorlund', 'firstname': 'Kristian', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Guyatt', 'firstname': 'Gordon H', 'initials': 'GH', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Johnston', 'firstname': 'Bradley C', 'initials': 'BC', 'affiliation': None}]",23728658,92c5771b-8f73-4790-8fb2-3f35f492d0fe,,DENIED: Wiley E Publisher says no to https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006095.pub3/pdf

This trial aimed to investigate whether the probiotic VSL#3 prevents AAD and CDAD in average-risk hospital patients.
Adult hospital inpatients exposed to systemic antibiotics were recruited to this multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. One sachet of VSL#3 or placebo was given twice daily for the length of the antibiotics course and for seven days thereafter. Primary outcomes were AAD and CDAD.
Patients randomized to active (N = 117) and placebo (N = 112) groups were well-matched for baseline demographic patient data. No cases of CDAD were detected. The rate of AAD was significantly lower in the active group on per protocol analysis (0% active vs 11.4% placebo; P = 0.006). On intention-to-treat analysis the difference in AAD incidence (4.3% active vs 8.9% placebo; P = 0.19) was not significant.
VSL#3 is associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of AAD in average-risk hospital inpatients exposed to systemic antibiotics. As the incidence of CDAD has fallen sharply, no cases of CDAD were found.

23464715,Virk et al.,"A randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial of an oral synbiotic (AKSB) for prevention of travelers' diarrhea.","Travelers' diarrhea (TD) is a significant problem for travelers. TD is treatable once it occurs, but few options for prevention exist. Probiotics have been studied for prevention or treatment of TD; however, very few combination probiotics have been studied. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if prophylactic use of an oral synbiotic could reduce the risk of acquiring TD and reduce antibiotic use if TD occurred.
Healthy subjects traveling to an area of the world with an increased risk of TD were eligible. All subjects received pre-travel counseling and were provided antibiotics and antidiarrheals (loperamide) for use only if TD developed. The subjects were blinded and randomized to take two capsules of placebo or oral synbiotic (a combination of two probiotics and a prebiotic) called Agri-King Synbiotic (AKSB) beginning 3 days prior to departure, daily while traveling, and for 7 days after return. All subjects kept symptom and medication diaries and submitted a stool sample for pathogen carriage within 7 days of return. The study was powered to detect a 50% reduction in the incidence of TD.
Of the 196 adults (over 18 years of age) enrolled in the study, 54.3% were female and 80.9% were younger than 60 years. The study randomized 94 people to the AKSB arm and 102 to placebo. The incidence of TD was 54.5% in the overall group with 55.3% in the AKSB arm and 53.9% in the placebo (p = 0.8864). Among the subjects who experienced diarrhea (n = 107) there was no significant difference in the proportion of subjects that took antibiotics versus those that did not take antibiotics (35% vs 29%, p = 0.68). AKSB was safe with no difference in toxicity between the two arms.
The prophylactic oral synbiotic was safe but did not reduce the risk of developing TD among travelers, nor did it decrease the duration of TD or the use of antibiotics when TD occurred.",[],Journal of travel medicine,10.1111/jtm.12008,2013-03-08,"[{'lastname': 'Virk', 'firstname': 'Abinash', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. virka@mayo.edu'}, {'lastname': 'Mandrekar', 'firstname': 'Jayawant', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Berbari', 'firstname': 'Elie F', 'initials': 'EF', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Boyce', 'firstname': 'Thomas G', 'initials': 'TG', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Fischer', 'firstname': 'Philip R', 'initials': 'PR', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kasten', 'firstname': 'Mary J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Orenstein', 'firstname': 'Robert', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rosenblatt', 'firstname': 'Jon E', 'initials': 'JE', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sampathkumar', 'firstname': 'Priya', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sia', 'firstname': 'Irene', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Springer', 'firstname': 'Donna', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Witzig', 'firstname': 'Thomas E', 'initials': 'TE', 'affiliation': None}]",23464715,92c5771b-8f73-4790-8fb2-3f35f492d0fe,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""J Travel Med"""

This may result in complications, the most serious of which is Clostridium difficile–associated diarrhea (CDAD).
To assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics for the prevention of CDAD in adults and children receiving antibiotics.
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Web of Science, and 12 gray-literature sources.
Randomized, controlled trials including adult or pediatric patients receiving antibiotics that compared any strain or dose of a specified probiotic with placebo or with no treatment control and reported the incidence of CDAD.
Two reviewers independently screened potentially eligible articles; extracted data on populations, interventions, and outcomes; and assessed risk of bias. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation guidelines were used to independently rate overall confidence in effect estimates for each outcome.
Twenty trials including 3818 participants met the eligibility criteria. Probiotics reduced the incidence of CDAD by 66% (pooled relative risk, 0.34 [95% CI, 0.24 to 0.49]; I(2) = 0%). In a population with a 5% incidence of antibiotic-associated CDAD (median control group risk), probiotic prophylaxis would prevent 33 episodes (CI, 25 to 38 episodes) per 1000 persons. Of probiotic-treated patients, 9.3% experienced adverse events, compared with 12.6% of control patients (relative risk, 0.82 [CI, 0.65 to 1.05]; I(2) = 17%).
In 13 trials, data on CDAD were missing for 5% to 45% of patients. The results were robust to worst-plausible assumptions regarding event rates in studies with missing outcome data.
Moderate-quality evidence suggests that probiotic prophylaxis results in a large reduction in CDAD without an increase in clinically important adverse events.

23302558,,"[Multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial on preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children with pneumonia using the live Clostridium butyricum and Bifidobacterium combined Powder].","Many previous meta-analysis have shown that the probiotics can lower the incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) in children. However, the function and efficacy of probiotics drugs showed obvious strains specificity and dose dependence. Currently, most of the reported meta-analysis regarding probiotics AAD prevention have adopted Saccharomyces, Lactobacilleae, Streptococcus and Bifidobacterium. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the live Clostridium butyricum and Bifidobacterium Powder to prevent AAD in hospitalized children with pneumonia.
This study was a multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial; 380 hospitalized children with pneumonia aged from 3 months to 3 years were enrolled from April to Dec. 2011. Totally 372 children completed the study, 179 children in control group received antibiotics as routine treatment for pneumonia; 193 children in treatment group received 5×10(9) colony-forming units of Clostridium butyricum and Bifidobacterium combined Powder daily for 7 days during the antibiotics treatment. The stool frequency and consistency (assessed according to the Bristol Excrement Assessment Scale) were observed for 7 consecutive days; the incidence of diarrhea and adverse drug reactions were recorded.
Both treatment and control groups were similar in age distribution, sex, type of antibiotics, route of administration, and time of antibiotics used. During the 7 days period, the rate of AAD was 7.8% (13/193) in treatment group and 16.8% (30/179) in control group, there was significant difference; compared with the control group, the treatment with Clostridium butyricum and Bifidobacterium combined Powder can lead to 53.6% reduction in AAD risk (RR = 0.419, 95%CI 0.217 - 0.808; P = 0.008). The severity of diarrhea was comparable in both study groups, as evidenced by similar stool frequency, dehydration, fever and vomiting. There was significant difference (P = 0.008) in the AAD occurrence time distribution between the treatment group and control group. No drug related adverse reactions (ADRs) were found during the observation period.

22559011,Allen et al.,A multicentre randomised controlled trial evaluating lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in older people admitted to hospital: the PLACIDE study protocol.,"Antibiotic associated diarrhoea complicates 5-39% of courses of antibiotic treatment. Major risk factors are increased age and admission to hospital. Of particular importance is C. difficile associated diarrhoea which occurs in about 4% of antibiotic courses and may result in severe illness, death and high healthcare costs. The emergence of the more virulent 027 strain of C. difficile has further heightened concerns. Probiotics may prevent antibiotic associated diarrhoea by several mechanisms including colonization resistance through maintaining a healthy gut flora.
This study aims to test the hypothesis that administration of a probiotic comprising two strains of lactobacilli and two strains of bifidobacteria alongside antibiotic treatment prevents antibiotic associated diarrhoea. We have designed a prospective, parallel group trial where people aged 65 years or more admitted to hospital and receiving one or more antibiotics are randomly allocated to receive either one capsule of the probiotic or a matching placebo daily for 21 days. The primary outcomes are the frequency of antibiotic associated and C. difficile diarrhoea during 8-12 weeks follow-up. To directly inform routine clinical practice, we will recruit a sufficient number of patients to demonstrate a 50% reduction in the frequency of C. difficile diarrhoea with a power of 80%. To maximize the generalizability of our findings and in view of the well-established safety record of probiotics, we will recruit a broad range of medical and surgical in-patients from two different health regions within the UK.
Antibiotic associated diarrhoea constitutes a significant health burden. In particular, current measures to prevent and control C. difficile diarrhoea are expensive and disrupt clinical care. This trial may have considerable significance for the prevention of antibiotic associated diarrhoea in hospitals.

22531096,"Videlock, Cremonini",Meta-analysis: probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.,"Diarrhoea is a common occurrence in association with antibiotic administration. Earlier studies and meta-analyses have suggested that probiotic administration reduces the incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD).
To estimate the reduction in risk of AAD with administration of probiotics in randomised placebo-controlled trials and to identify factors associated with such reduction.
Meta-analysis of randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials including patients treated with antibiotics and administered a probiotic for at least the duration of the antibiotic treatment. The outcome was incidence of diarrhoea irrespective of the presence of Clostridium difficile or the development of pseudomembranous colitis. Meta-analysis and meta-regression methods were used to synthesise data and to assess influence of: mean age, duration of antibiotics, risk of bias and incidence of diarrhoea in the placebo group on outcomes. Subgroup analyses explored effects of different probiotic species, patient populations and treatment indications.
A total of 34 studies were included with 4138 patients. The pooled relative risk (RR) for AAD in the probiotic group vs. placebo was 0.53 (95% CI 0.44-0.63), corresponding to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 8 (95% CI 7-11). The preventive effect of probiotics remained significant when grouped by probiotic species, population age group, relative duration of antibiotics and probiotics, study risk of bias and probiotic administered. The pooled RR for AAD during treatment for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) was 0.37 (95% CI 0.20-0.69), corresponding to a NNT of 5 (95% CI 4-10).

Probiotics were effective in preventing AAD and CDAD in several randomized controlled trials. This study was aimed at testing the effect of Saccharomyces boulardii on the occurrence of AAD and CDAD in hospitalized patients.
A single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial was performed. Patients being prescribed antibiotics or on antibiotic therapy for <48 h were eligible. Exclusion criteria were ongoing diarrhea, recent assumption of probiotics, lack of informed consent, inability to ingest capsules, and severe pancreatitis. Patients received a capsule containing S. boulardii or an indistinguishable placebo twice daily within 48 h of beginning antibiotic therapy, continued treatment for 7 days after antibiotic withdrawal, and were followed for 12 weeks after ending antibiotic treatment.
Of 562 consecutive eligible patients, 275 patients aged 79.2 ± 9.8 years (134 on placebo) were randomized and 204 aged 78.4 ± 10.0 years (98 on placebo) completed the follow-up. AAD developed in 13.3% (13/98) of the patients receiving placebo and in 15.1% (16/106) of those receiving S. boulardii (odds ratio for S. boulardii vs. placebo, 1.16; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.53-2.56). Five cases of CDAD occurred, 2 in the placebo group (2.0%) and 3 in the probiotic group (2.8%; odds ratio for S. boulardii vs. placebo, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.23-8.55).

22071814,Johnston et al.,Probiotics for the prevention of pediatric antibiotic-associated diarrhea.,"Antibiotics alter the microbial balance within the gastrointestinal tract. Probiotics may prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) via restoration of the gut microflora. Antibiotics are prescribed frequently in children and AAD is common in this population.
The primary objectives were to assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics (any specified strain or dose) used for the prevention of AAD in children.
MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, AMED, and the Web of Science (inception to May 2010) were searched along with specialized registers including the Cochrane IBD/FBD review group, CISCOM (Centralized Information Service for Complementary Medicine), NHS Evidence, the International Bibliographic Information on Dietary Supplements as well as trial registries. Letters were sent to authors of included trials, nutra/pharmaceutical companies, and experts in the field requesting additional information on ongoing or unpublished trials. Conference proceedings, dissertation abstracts, and reference lists from included and relevant articles were also searched.
Randomized, parallel, controlled trials in children (0 to 18 years) receiving antibiotics, that compare probiotics to placebo, active alternative prophylaxis, or no treatment and measure the incidence of diarrhea secondary to antibiotic use were considered for inclusion.
Study selection, data extraction as well as methodological quality assessment using the risk of bias instrument was conducted independently and in duplicate by two authors. Dichotomous data (incidence of diarrhea, adverse events) were combined using a pooled relative risk and risk difference (adverse events), and continuous data (mean duration of diarrhea, mean daily stool frequency) as weighted mean differences, along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals. For overall pooled results on the incidence of diarrhea, sensitivity analyses included available case versus extreme-plausible analyses and random- versus fixed-effect models. To explore possible explanations for heterogeneity, a priori subgroup analysis were conducted on probiotic strain, dose, definition of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, antibiotic agent as well as risk of bias.
Sixteen studies (3432 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Trials included treatment with either Bacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacilli spp., Lactococcus spp., Leuconostoc cremoris, Saccharomyces spp., or Streptococcus spp., alone or in combination. Nine studies used a single strain probiotic agent, four combined two probiotic strains, one combined three probiotic strains, one product included ten probiotic agents, and one study included two probiotic arms that used three and two strains respectively. The risk of bias was determined to be high in 8 studies and low in 8 studies. Available case (patients who did not complete the studies were not included in the analysis) results from 15/16 trials reporting on the incidence of diarrhea show a large, precise benefit from probiotics compared to active, placebo or no treatment control. The incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 9% compared to 18% in the control group (2874 participants; RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.72; I(2) = 56%). This benefit was not statistically significant in an extreme plausible (60% of children loss to follow-up in probiotic group and 20% loss to follow-up in the control group had diarrhea) intention to treat (ITT) sensitivity analysis. The incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 16% compared to 18% in the control group (3392 participants; RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.04; I(2) = 59%). An a priori available case subgroup analysis exploring heterogeneity indicated that high dose (≥5 billion CFUs/day) is more effective than low probiotic dose (< 5 billion CFUs/day), interaction P value = 0.010. For the high dose studies the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% compared to 22% in the control group (1474 participants; RR 0.40; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.55). For the low dose studies the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% compared to 11% in the control group (1382 participants; RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.53 to 1.21). An extreme plausible ITT subgroup analysis was marginally significant for high dose probiotics. For the high dose studies the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 17% compared to 22% in the control group (1776 participants; RR 0.72; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.99; I(2) = 58%). None of the 11 trials (n = 1583) that reported on adverse events documented any serious adverse events. Meta-analysis excluded all but an extremely small non-significant difference in adverse events between treatment and control (RD 0.00; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.02).
Despite heterogeneity in probiotic strain, dose, and duration, as well as in study quality, the overall evidence suggests a protective effect of probiotics in preventing AAD. Using 11 criteria to evaluate the credibility of the subgroup analysis on probiotic dose, the results indicate that the subgroup effect based on dose (≥5 billion CFU/day) was credible. Based on high-dose probiotics, the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one case of diarrhea is seven (NNT 7; 95% CI 6 to 10). However, a GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for the primary endpoint (incidence of diarrhea) was low due to issues with risk of bias (due to high loss to follow-up) and imprecision (sparse data, 225 events). The benefit for high dose probiotics (Lactobacillus rhamnosus or Saccharomyces boulardii) needs to be confirmed by a large well-designed randomized trial. More refined trials are also needed that test strain specific probiotics and evaluate the efficacy (e.g. incidence and duration of diarrhea) and safety of probiotics with limited losses to follow-up. It is premature to draw conclusions about the efficacy and safety of other probiotic agents for pediatric AAD. Future trials would benefit from a standard and valid outcomes to measure AAD.",[],The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,10.1002/14651858.CD004827.pub3,2011-11-11,"[{'lastname': 'Johnston', 'firstname': 'Bradley C', 'initials': 'BC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada. bradley.johnston@sickkids.ca'}, {'lastname': 'Goldenberg', 'firstname': 'Joshua Z', 'initials': 'JZ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Vandvik', 'firstname': 'Per O', 'initials': 'PO', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sun', 'firstname': 'Xin', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Guyatt', 'firstname': 'Gordon H', 'initials': 'GH', 'affiliation': None}]",22071814,92c5771b-8f73-4790-8fb2-3f35f492d0fe,,DENIED: Wiley E Publisher says no to https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004827.pub3/pdf
22023067,"Kamdeu Fansi, Guertin, LeLorier",Savings from the use of a probiotic formula in the prophylaxis of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.,"Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and particularly Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) are the most common causes of healthcare associated infectious diarrhea. A double-blind, dose response, placebo-controlled trial of the probiotic formula (Bio-K+ Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285 and Lactobacillus casei LBC80R formula) for prophylaxis of AAD and CDAD was published in 2010. The Bio-K+ Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285 and Lactobacillus casei LBC80R formula is a registered trademark of Bio-K Plus International Inc. (Laval, Québec, Canada). Results indicated that the incidence of AAD and CDAD were lower for patients assigned to the probiotic formula compared with the placebo option. The present study aims to estimate the savings in direct medical costs that might result from the use of two different doses of the probiotic formula vs placebo.
A cost-consequence analysis was conducted to compare the two doses of the probiotic formula compared to placebo. The analysis was based upon published data and adjusted to the North American context.
Economic analyses showed that the use of the probiotic formula would result in estimated mean per patients savings of US$1968 for the single dose and US$2661 for the double dose compared with the placebo option if used an average of 13 days by all patients at risk of developing AAD and CDAD.
Several key parameters considered within the economic model were not captured within the Gao et al. study. Numerous sensitivity analyses were conducted to address this issue.
The use of the probiotic formula in prophylaxis of AAD and CDAD would lead to estimated savings in direct medical costs that would substantially offset its acquisition cost. Treating 1000 hospitalized patients on antibiotics with the double dose of the product compared to current practice would save a single payer system the sum of $2,661,218.",[],Journal of medical economics,10.3111/13696998.2011.629015,2011-10-26,"[{'lastname': 'Kamdeu Fansi', 'firstname': 'Alvine Adrienne', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'Pharmacoeconomic and Pharmacoepidemiology Research Unit, Research Center, Centre Hospitalier de l’Université de Montréal, Hôtel-Dieu, Montreal, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Guertin', 'firstname': 'Jason Robert', 'initials': 'JR', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'LeLorier', 'firstname': 'Jacques', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}]",22023067,92c5771b-8f73-4790-8fb2-3f35f492d0fe,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""J Med Econ"""
21899583,"Vandenplas, De Hert",Randomised clinical trial: the synbiotic food supplement Probiotical vs. placebo for acute gastroenteritis in children.,"Some probiotic strains reduce the duration of acute diarrhoea. As a result of strain and product specificity, each product needs support by clinical data.
In children with acute diarrhoea, to test the efficacy of the synbiotic food supplement Probiotical (Streptoccoccus thermophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium lactis, Bifidobacterium infantis, fructo-oligosaccharides). The primary end-points were duration of diarrhoea and the number of children that had a normalised stool consistency.
A total of 111 children with acute diarrhoea (median age 40 months) were included in this randomised, prospective placebo-controlled parallel clinical trial in primary health care. All children were treated with oral rehydration solution ad libitum and with the synbiotic (n=57) or placebo (n = 54).
The median duration of diarrhoea was 3 days (IQ 25-75: 2-4 days) in the Probiotical group, compared with 4 days (IQ 25-75: 4-5 days) in the placebo group (P<0.005). The number of children with normal stool consistency (defined as stool Bristol score ≤4) was higher in the synbiotic group on days 2 and 3 [21 vs. 2% (P<0.001) and 50 vs. 24% (P<0.001) respectively]. Less additional medication (antipyretics, antiemetics, antibiotics) was administered in the synbiotic group. Physicians were globally more satisfied with the synbiotic food supplement treatment than with placebo (P=0.005). One patient in the placebo group was hospitalised.

It is unknown whether probiotic modification of the upper aerodigestive flora can reduce nosocomial infections.
To determine whether oropharyngeal and gastric administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG can reduce the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
We performed a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 146 mechanically ventilated patients at high risk of developing VAP. Patients were randomly assigned to receive enteral probiotics (n = 68) or an inert inulin-based placebo (n = 70) twice a day in addition to routine care.
Patients treated with Lactobacillus were significantly less likely to develop microbiologically confirmed VAP compared with patients treated with placebo (40.0 vs. 19.1%; P = 0.007). Although patients treated with probiotics had significantly less Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea than patients treated with placebo (18.6 vs. 5.8%; P = 0.02), the duration of diarrhea per episode was not different between groups (13.2 ± 7.4 vs. 9.8 ± 4.9 d; P = 0.39).

Evidence suggests that probiotics may be beneficial in preventing and decreasing the severity of AAD.
Adult patients who were prescribed antibiotics for 3-14 days were enrolled from eight Canadian centers. Study treatment was randomized at a 1 : 1 ratio of BIO-K+CL1285( (®) ) or placebo and was administered within 24 h of initiation to 5 days after termination of antibiotherapy. Patients were followed for 21 days after last dose of study treatment. The primary outcome was severity and incidence of AAD. Severity was measured by the total number of days with diarrhea and incidence was defined as the number of patients with at least one day with diarrhea over the total number of patients enrolled in the study.
216 patients were randomized to BIO-K+ and 221 to placebo. The mean (SD) number of days with diarrhea was 1.19. (3.20) days for the placebo and 0.67 (2.05) days for BIO-K+CL1285( (®) ) (p = 0.040). Adjusted multivariate linear regression results showed that the duration of diarrhea for BIO-K+CL1285 (®)vs. placebo was reduced by 51.5% (b[SE] = 0.515 [0.256], p = 0.045). The incidence of diarrhea was 21.8% for the BIO-K+ and 29.4% for the placebo group (OR = 0.667, p = 0.067). Multivariate logistic regression, showed that the adjusted odds ratio of AAD in patients receiving BIO-K+ vs. placebo was 0.627 (p = 0.037). Study treatment was well tolerated.
BIO-K+ is effective for preventing and reducing the severity of AAD in patients receiving antibiotic therapy in a hospital setting.","['acidophilus', 'antibiotic associated diarrhea', 'lactobacillus', 'probiotics']",Archives of medical science : AMS,10.5114/aoms.2010.13508,2010-03-01,"[{'lastname': 'Sampalis', 'firstname': 'John', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'JSS Medical Research Inc., Montreal, Quebec, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Psaradellis', 'firstname': 'Eliofotisti', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rampakakis', 'firstname': 'Emmanouil', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}]","22371721

20145608,Gao et al.,Dose-response efficacy of a proprietary probiotic formula of Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285 and Lactobacillus casei LBC80R for antibiotic-associated diarrhea and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea prophylaxis in adult patients.,"Standard therapies for antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) have limited efficacy. Probiotic prophylaxis is a promising alternative for reduction of AAD and CDAD incidence.
In this single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-ranging study, we randomized 255 adult inpatients to one of three groups: two probiotic capsules per day (Pro-2, n=86), one probiotic capsule and one placebo capsule per day (Pro-1, n=85), or two placebo capsules per day (n=84). Each probiotic capsule contained 50 billion c.f.u. of live organisms (Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285 +Lactobacillus casei LBC80R Bio-K+ CL1285). Probiotic prophylaxis began within 36 h of initial antibiotic administration, continued for 5 days after the last antibiotic dose, and patients were followed for an additional 21 days.
Pro-2 (15.5%) had a lower AAD incidence vs. Pro-1 (28.2%). Each probiotic group had a lower AAD incidence vs. placebo (44.1%). In patients who acquired AAD, Pro-2 (2.8 days) and Pro-1 (4.1 days) had shorter symptom duration vs. placebo (6.4 days). Similarly, Pro-2 (1.2%) had a lower CDAD incidence vs. Pro-1 (9.4%). Each treatment group had a lower CDAD incidence vs. placebo (23.8%). Gastrointestinal symptoms were less common in the treatment groups vs. placebo and in Pro-2 vs. Pro-1.
The proprietary probiotic blend used in this study was well tolerated and effective for reducing risk of AAD and, in particular, CDAD in hospitalized patients on antibiotics. A dose-ranging effect was shown with 100 billion c.f.u., yielding superior outcomes and fewer gastrointestinal events compared to 50 billion c.f.u.

The yeast Saccharomyces boulardii has been found to have some effect in reducing the risk of C difficile infection (CDI); however, its role in preventive therapy has yet to be firmly established.
To review the effectiveness of S boulardii in the prevention of primary and recurrent CDI. Benefit was defined as a reduction of diarrhea associated with C difficile. Risk was defined as any adverse effects of S boulardii.
A literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library was performed. Included studies were English language, randomized, double-blind placebo controlled trials evaluating S boulardii in CDI prevention.
Four studies were reviewed. Two studies investigated the prevention of recurrence in populations that were experiencing CDI at baseline. One trial showed a reduction of relapses in patients experiencing recurrent CDI (RR=0.53; P<0.05). The other demonstrated a trend toward reduction of CDI relapse in the recurrent treatment group of patients receiving high-dose vancomycin (RR=0.33; P=0.05). Two other studies examined primary prevention of CDI in populations that had been recently prescribed antibiotics. These studies lacked the power to detect statistically significant differences. Patients on treatment experienced increased risk for thirst and constipation.
S boulardii seems to be well tolerated and may be effective for secondary prevention in some specific patient populations with particular concurrent antibiotic treatment. Its role in primary prevention is poorly defined and more research is required before changes in practice are recommended.

19727002,Lönnermark et al.,Intake of Lactobacillus plantarum reduces certain gastrointestinal symptoms during treatment with antibiotics.,"To examine if intake of Lactobacillus plantarum can prevent gastrointestinal side effects in antibiotic-treated patients.
Diarrhea is a common side effect of treatment with antibiotics. Some studies indicate that the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea can be reduced by administration of certain probiotic microorganisms.
Patients treated for infections at a university hospital infectious diseases clinic were randomized to daily intake of either a fruit drink with L. plantarum 299v (10(10) colony forming units/d) or a placebo drink, until a week after termination of antibiotic treatment. Subjects recorded the number and consistency of stools as well as gastrointestinal symptoms until up to 3 weeks after last intake of test drink. Fecal samples were collected before the first intake of test drink and after termination of antibiotic therapy and analyzed for Clostridium difficile toxin.
Clinical characteristics on admission were similar in the 2 groups. The overall risk of developing loose or watery stools was significantly lower among those receiving L. plantarum [odds ratio (OR), 0.69; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.52-0.92; P=0.012], as was development of nausea (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.30-0.85; P=0.0097). Diarrhea defined as > or =3 loose stools/24 h for > or =2 consecutive days was unaffected by the treatment (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.33-6.0; P=0.86). No significant differences regarding carriage of toxin producing C. difficile were observed between the groups.

19359104,"Graul, Cain, Karpa",Lactobacillus and bifidobacteria combinations: a strategy to reduce hospital-acquired Clostridium difficile diarrhea incidence and mortality.,"Incidence and virulence of Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD) is increasing, particularly in institutional settings. Morbidity, mortality, and costs associated with this condition are high. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have long been recognized as the primary risk factor for CDAD due to disruption of protective normal gastrointestinal flora. We suggest that administration of appropriate lactobacilli and bifidobacteria probiotics could be employed as a strategy to protect hospitalized patients from CDAD by normalizing disrupted gastrointestinal flora, resulting in fewer cases per admission. Routine use of probiotics within institutional settings may substantially decrease healthcare costs. To date, relatively little is known about the role of probiotics as a means of preventing initial CDAD diagnosis. Although two reports suggestive of benefits have been published, these studies have been either too under-powered to draw definitive conclusions or have employed such restrictive inclusion criteria that results are not generalizable to most hospitalized adults. Since CDAD is an opportunistic infection associated with disrupted gut flora, it is logical to employ a strategy that modulates gut flora as a preventative approach. Herein, we report pilot data that is strongly suggestive that bifidobacteria and lactobacilli combinations may be effective in preventing this hospital-acquired infection and possibly reducing severity when diagnosed. These data are generalizable to all hospital patients since few exclusion criteria were employed. Limitations to these data are acknowledged since the pilot was not conducted in a placebo-controlled manner. Although generalizable, lack of a placebo precludes a definitive answer in terms of efficacy that lactobacilli and bifidobacteria may provide in CDAD prevention. Given substantial morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with CDAD, appropriately-designed clinical trials are warranted.",[],Medical hypotheses,10.1016/j.mehy.2009.02.026,2009-04-11,"[{'lastname': 'Graul', 'firstname': 'Terry', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'American Board Certified Clin-Path Associates, PC, 1255 West Washington Street, Tempe, AZ 85281-1201, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Cain', 'firstname': 'Alisha M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Karpa', 'firstname': 'Kelly D', 'initials': 'KD', 'affiliation': None}]",19359104,92c5771b-8f73-4790-8fb2-3f35f492d0fe,,TXERROR: 403 status returned from  url (http://www.medical-hypotheses.com/article/S0306-9877(09)00160-1/pdf)

The absolute risk reduction was 21.6% (6.6% to 36.6%), and the number needed to treat was 5 (3 to 15). No one in the probiotic group and 9/53 (17%) in the placebo group had diarrhoea caused by C difficile (P=0.001). The absolute risk reduction was 17% (7% to 27%), and the number needed to treat was 6 (4 to 14).
Consumption of a probiotic drink containing L casei, L bulgaricus, and S thermophilus can reduce the incidence of antibiotic associated diarrhoea and C difficile associated diarrhoea. This has the potential to decrease morbidity, healthcare costs, and mortality if used routinely in patients aged over 50.

17443557,Johnston et al.,Probiotics for the prevention of pediatric antibiotic-associated diarrhea.,"Antibiotics alter the microbial balance within the gastrointestinal tract. Probiotics may prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) via restoration of the gut microflora. Antibiotics are prescribed frequently in children and AAD is common in this population.
To assess the efficacy and adverse effects of probiotics (any specified strain or dose) for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children. To assess adverse events associated with the use of probiotics when co-administered with antibiotics in children.
MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL , AMED, and the Web of Science (inception to August 2006) were searched along with specialized registers including the Cochrane IBD/FBD Review Group, CISCOM, Chalmers PedCAM Research Register and trial registries from inception to 2005. Letters were sent to authors of included trials, nutra/pharmaceutical companies, and experts in the field requesting additional information on ongoing or unpublished trials. Conference proceedings, dissertation abstracts, and reference lists from included and relevant articles were hand searched.
Randomized, parallel, controlled (placebo, active, or no treatment) trials comparing co-administered probiotics with antibiotics for the prevention of diarrhea secondary to antibiotic use in children (0 to 18 years).
Methodological quality assessment and data extraction were conducted independently by two authors (BCJ, AS). Dichotomous data (incidence of diarrhea, adverse events) were combined using pooled relative risks, and continuous data (mean duration of diarrhea, mean daily stool frequency) as weighted mean differences, along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Adverse events were summarized using risk difference. For overall pooled results on the incidence of diarrhea, a priori sensitivity analyses included per protocol versus intention to treat, random versus fixed effects, and methodological quality criterion. Subgroup analysis were conducted on probiotic strain, dose, definition of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and antibiotic agent.
Ten studies met the inclusion criteria. Trials included treatment with either Lactobacilli spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Streptococcus spp., or Saccharomyces boulardii alone or in combination. Six studies used a single strain probiotic agent and four combined two probiotic strains. The per protocol analysis for 9/10 trials reporting on the incidence of diarrhea show statistically significant results favouring probiotics over active/non active controls (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.74). However, intention to treat analysis showed non-significant results overall (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.63). Five of ten trials monitored for adverse events (n = 647); none reported a serious adverse event.
Probiotics show promise for the prevention of pediatric AAD. While per protocol analysis yields treatment effect estimates that are both statistically and clinically significant, as does analysis of high quality studies, the estimate from the intention to treat analysis was not statistically significant. Future studies should involve probiotic strains and doses with the most promising evidence (e.g., Lactobacillus GG, Lactobacillus sporogenes, Saccharomyces boulardii at 5 to 40 billion colony forming units/day). Research done to date does not permit determination of the effect of age (e.g., infant versus older children) or antibiotic duration (e.g., 5 days versus 10 days). Future trials would benefit from a validated primary outcome measure for antibiotic-associated diarrhea that is sensitive to change and reflects what treatment effect clinicians, parents, and children consider important. The current data are promising, but it is premature to routinely recommend probiotics for the prevention of pediatric AAD.",[],The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,10.1002/14651858.CD004827.pub2,2007-04-20,"[{'lastname': 'Johnston', 'firstname': 'B C', 'initials': 'BC', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Supina', 'firstname': 'A L', 'initials': 'AL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ospina', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Vohra', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]",17443557,92c5771b-8f73-4790-8fb2-3f35f492d0fe,,DENIED: Wiley E Publisher says no to https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004827.pub2/pdf

16908901,"Johnston, Supina, Vohra",Probiotics for pediatric antibiotic-associated diarrhea: a meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials.,"Antibiotic treatment is known to disturb gastrointestinal microflora, which results in a range of clinical symptoms--most notably, diarrhea. This is especially important in children, for whom antibiotics are prescribed frequently. Although meta-analyses have been conducted to evaluate the ability of probiotics to prevent antibiotic-induced diarrhea in the general population, little is known about which probiotic strains and doses might be of most benefit to children. Our objective in this study was to assess the efficacy of probiotics (of any specified strain or dose) for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children and to assess adverse events associated with the use of probiotics when coadministered with antibiotics to children.
A comprehensive search was performed of the major electronic databases (e.g., CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED) from their inception to January 2005. We also contacted experts and searched registries and meeting abstracts for additional relevant articles. Randomized controlled trials that compared probiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment, involving pediatric subjects less than 19 years of age were included. Two reviewers independently applied eligibility criteria and assessed the studies for methodological quality. Data were independently extracted by 2 reviewers and analyzed via the standard Cochrane methodology.
Six studies were included (total n = 707 patients). The combined results, analyzed with a per-protocol method that reported on the incidence of diarrhea during antibiotic treatment, showed significant benefit for the use of probiotics over placebo (relative risk [RR] 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25-0.75, Iota2 = 70.1%). In contrast, results from intention-to-treat analysis were nonsignificant overall (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.64-1.61). Subgroup analysis on 4 studies that provided at least 5 billion single-strain colony-forming units (CFUs) daily (range 5.5-40 x 10(9) Lactobacillus GG, L. sporogens or Saccharomyces boulardii) showed strong evidence with narrow CIs for the preventative effects of probiotics for antibiotic-associated diarrhea (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.25-0.53, Iota2 = 3.5%). No serious adverse events were reported.
The potential protective effects of probiotics to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children do not withstand intention-to-treat analysis. Before routine use is recommended, further studies (with limited losses of subjects to follow-up) are merited. Trials should involve those probiotic strains and doses with the most promising evidence (i.e., Lactobacillus GG, L. sporogens or S. boulardii at 5-40 x 10(9) CFUs daily).",[],CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,10.1503/cmaj.051603,2006-08-16,"[{'lastname': 'Johnston', 'firstname': 'Bradley C', 'initials': 'BC', 'affiliation': ""Complementary and Alternative Research and Education (CARE) Program, Stollery Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alta.""}, {'lastname': 'Supina', 'firstname': 'Alison L', 'initials': 'AL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Vohra', 'firstname': 'Sunita', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]","16908901

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Saccharomyces boulardii in preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in patients receiving antibiotics for H. pylori eradication.
In a multicentre prospective clinical trial, patients with peptic ulcer disease or non-ulcer dyspepsia were enrolled to receive clarithromycin, amoxicillin and omeprazole for H. pylori eradication for 14 days. These patients were then randomized to receive either S. boulardii 500 mg twice daily (treatment group) or no treatment (control group). The primary outcome measure was the development of diarrhoea during (treatment period) or within 4 weeks after treatment (follow-up period).
Of the 389 patients that were enrolled, 376 completed the study. Within the treatment period, diarrhoea developed in 5.9% of patients in the treatment group and in 11.5% of patients in the control group (P = 0.049); and in the follow-up period, diarrhoea developed in 1.0% of patients in the treatment group and in 3.8% of patients in the control group (P = 0.09). Overall diarrhoea rates throughout the whole study period were 6.9% in the treatment group and 15.6% in the control group (P = 0.007).

To determine whether S. boulardii prevents antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in children.
A total of 269 children (aged 6 months to 14 years) with otitis media and/or respiratory tract infections were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial in which they received standard antibiotic treatment plus 250 mg of S. boulardii (experimental group, n = 132) or a placebo (control group, n = 137) orally twice daily for the duration of antibiotic treatment.

12913674,"Meier, Burri, Steuerwald",The role of nutrition in diarrhoea syndromes.,"Diarrhoea is a common and worldwide problem, accounting for significant morbidity and mortality, especially in children. This paper reviews recent advances in the field of nutritional intervention for the prevention and treatment of diarrhoeal diseases.
In the developing countries, the incidence of diarrhoeal diseases remains unchanged, whereas in industrialized areas a decrease has been reported. In acute diarrhoea, oral rehydration therapy is the treatment of first choice. Newer oral rehydration solutions with amylase-resistant starch or partially hydrolysed guar gum have been tested and found to be useful. Promising new data on supplementation with zinc in acute diarrhoea were published last year. The use of prebiotics and probiotics in the prevention and the treatment of diarrhoea is still controversial. However, new data and meta-analyses with probiotics are available, showing benefits in the treatment of acute diarrhoea as a co-treatment with oral rehydration. The same benefits were found to apply to antibiotic-associated diarrhoea syndromes. The co-administration of probiotics to patients receiving antibiotics seems to be a promising approach for reducing the incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. New evidence suggests that fibre reduces diarrhoea associated with enteral tube feeding. Furthermore, a new probiotic mixture (VSL-3, viable lyophilized bacteria of 4 strains of Lactobacillus, 3 strains of Bifidobacterium and 1 strain of Streptococcus thermophilus (VSL Pharmaceuticals, Inc,. Ft. Lauderdale, FL. USA)) was of benefit in the treatment of bacterial overgrowth and in the prevention of diarrhoea after pelvic radiation treatment.
Oral rehydration is still the first line of treatment for acute diarrhoea. Zinc supplements have been shown to have a beneficial effect on acute diarrhoea in children. Probiotics and fibre have proved to be useful in the prevention and treatment of several diarrhoea syndromes. Because of the small numbers of patients and shortcomings in design and analysis, additional large placebo-controlled trials of the effects of fibre and probiotics, or a combination of both, in diarrhoea syndromes are needed.",[],Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,10.1097/00075197-200309000-00010,2003-08-13,"[{'lastname': 'Meier', 'firstname': 'Rémy', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Clinical Nutrition, University Hospital, Kantonsspital Liestal, CH-4410 Liestal, Switzerland. remy.meier@ksli.ch'}, {'lastname': 'Burri', 'firstname': 'Emanuel', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Steuerwald', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}]",12913674,92c5771b-8f73-4790-8fb2-3f35f492d0fe,,DENIED: wolterskluwer did not provide PDF link for this article
12403254,Jirapinyo et al.,Prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in infants by probiotics.,"Probiotics administration has been claimed to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The investigators thus conducted a double blind, placebo controlled study of providing probiotics to infants and children with severe bacterial infections and receiving broad spechum antibiotics.

12052801,D'Souza et al.,Probiotics in prevention of antibiotic associated diarrhoea: meta-analysis.,"To evaluate efficacy of probiotics in prevention and treatment of diarrhoea associated with the use of antibiotics.
Meta-analysis; outcome data (proportion of patients not getting diarrhoea) were analysed, pooled, and compared to determine odds ratios in treated and control groups.
Studies identified by searching Medline between 1966 and 2000 and the Cochrane Library. Studies reviewed Nine randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trials of probiotics.
Two of the nine studies investigated the effects of probiotics in children. Four trials used a yeast (Saccharomyces boulardii), four used lactobacilli, and one used a strain of enterococcus that produced lactic acid. Three trials used a combination of probiotic strains of bacteria. In all nine trials, the probiotics were given in combination with antibiotics and the control groups received placebo and antibiotics. The odds ratio in favour of active treatment over placebo in preventing diarrhoea associated with antibiotics was 0.39 (95% confidence interval 0.25 to 0.62; P<0.001) for the yeast and 0.34 (0.19 to 0.61; P<0.01 for lactobacilli. The combined odds ratio was 0.37 (0.26 to 0.53; P<0.001) in favour of active treatment over placebo.
The meta-analysis suggests that probiotics can be used to prevent antibiotic associated diarrhoea and that S boulardii and lactobacilli have the potential to be used in this situation. The efficacy of probiotics in treating antibiotic associated diarrhoea remains to be proved. A further large trial in which probiotics are used as preventive agents should look at the costs of and need for routine use of these agents.",[],BMJ (Clinical research ed.),10.1136/bmj.324.7350.1361,2002-06-08,"[{'lastname': ""D'Souza"", 'firstname': 'Aloysius L', 'initials': 'AL', 'affiliation': 'Care of the Elderly Section, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College School of Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, London W12 0NN. aloysius.dsouza@ic.ac.uk'}, {'lastname': 'Rajkumar', 'firstname': 'Chakravarthi', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Cooke', 'firstname': 'Jonathan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bulpitt', 'firstname': 'Christopher J', 'initials': 'CJ', 'affiliation': None}]","12052801

11118872,Bergogne-Bérézin,Treatment and prevention of antibiotic associated diarrhea.,"Mild or severe episodes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) are common side effects of antibiotic therapy. The incidence of AAD differs with the antibiotic and varies from 5 to 25%. The major form of intestinal disorders is the pseudomembranous colitis associated with Clostridium difficile which occurs in 10-20% of all AAD. In most cases of AAD discontinuation or replacement of the inciting antibiotic by another drug with lower AAD risk can be effective. For more severe cases involving C. difficile, the treatment of diarrhea requires an antibiotic treatment, with glycopeptides (vancomycin) or metronidazole. Another approach to AAD treatment or prevention is based on the use of non-pathogenic living organisms, capable of re-establishing the equilibrium of the intestinal ecosystem. Several organisms have been used in treatment or prophylaxis of AAD such as selected strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium longum, and Enterococcus faecium. Another biotherapeutic agent, a non-pathogenic yeast, Saccharomyces boulardii has been used. In animal models of C. difficile colitis initiated by clindamycin, animals treated with S. boulardii (at end of vancomycin therapy) had a significant decrease in C. difficile colony-forming units, and of toxin B production. In several clinical randomised trials (versus placebo), S. boulardii has demonstrated its effectiveness by decreasing significantly the occurrence of C. difficile colitis and preventing the pathogenic effects of toxins A and B of C. difficile. It has been shown to be a safe and effective therapy in relapses of C. difficile colitis. A good response has been seen in children with AAD, treated by S. boulardii only. In ICUs prevention of AAD remains based on limitation of antibiotic overuse and spread of C. difficile or other agents of AAD should be prevented by improved hygiene measures (single rooms, private bathrooms for patients, use of gloves and hand washing for personnel). In addition the increasing use of biotherapeutic agents such as S. boulardii should permit the prevention of the major side effect of antibiotics, i.e. AAD in at risk patients.",[],International journal of antimicrobial agents,10.1016/s0924-8579(00)00293-4,2000-12-19,"[{'lastname': 'Bergogne-Bérézin', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Microbiology Department, University Paris 7, 100 bis rue du Cherche-Midi, 75006 Paris, France. berezbiol@aol.com'}]",11118872,92c5771b-8f73-4790-8fb2-3f35f492d0fe,,DENIED: ScienceDirect did not provide pdf link (probably paywalled)

When antibiotics, stress, disease or medications disrupt normal microflora, the ability to ward off infection by pathogens is compromised. The use of beneficial microbes (also known as biotherapeutic agents, probiotics, synbiotics) has been shown to be an effective therapeutic agent for some diseases. Various types of diarrhoea (antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, Clostridium difficile disease, traveller's diarrhoea) are most responsive to these beneficial microbes. Serious risks associated with these microbes are largely theoretical at this point, but the risks need to be studied as the use of these beneficial microbes increases in popularity. Beneficial microbes are living organisms used as therapeutic agents to restore the health of the host in times when normal microflora have been disturbed. The efficacy to prevent or treat diarrhoea has been documented in multiple large, placebo-controlled, blinded clinical trials with only a few of these beneficial microbes.

10634221,Pochapin,The effect of probiotics on Clostridium difficile diarrhea.,"Clostridium difficile is the leading cause of nosocomially acquired intestinal infection in the United States, affecting virtually all cases of pseudomembranous colitis and up to 20% of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Even after receiving antibiotic treatment with either metronidazole or vancomycin, 20% of patients will have recurrent Clostridium difficile diarrhea. An innovative approach to the problem involves the introduction of competing, nonpathogenic (probiotic) organisms into the intestinal tract to restore microbial balance. The theoretical premise behind this approach is that the protective intestinal microflora is damaged by antibiotic treatment; the initial antibiotic exposure thus leaves the host susceptible to colonization and subsequent infection by Clostridium difficile. A so-called ""second-hit"" to the intestinal microflora occurs when the infected host is treated with flagyl or vancomycin, further destroying susceptible bacterial flora. Probiotic agents, such as Lactobacillus GG and Saccharomyces boulardii, have been studied for the treatment of Clostridium difficile. We are currently running a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of Lactobacillus GG in combination with standard antibiotics for the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection. Although it is too early to draw statistically significant conclusions, two patterns seem to be emerging: Lactobacillus GG is effective in reducing the 3-wk recurrence rate of Clostridium difficile, and patients feel better when taking Lactobacillus GG, as compared with the placebo, with early disappearance of abdominal cramps and diarrhea. In conclusion, the use of probiotics for the treatment of primary and recurrent Clostridium difficile diarrhea looks promising. Patients seem to have less recurrent Clostridium difficile diarrhea and early symptomatic improvement when using the probiotic Lactobacillus GG.",[],The American journal of gastroenterology,10.1016/s0002-9270(99)00809-6,2000-01-14,"[{'lastname': 'Pochapin', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Cornell Medical Center, The New York Hospital, New York 10021, USA.'}]",10634221,92c5771b-8f73-4790-8fb2-3f35f492d0fe,,DENIED: Nature url (https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002927099008096) did not result in a PDF

Very limited information is available, however, on the potential role of such agents in non-rotaviral diarrheal episodes. Furthermore, no evidence is available concerning the efficacy of Lactobacillus GG administered in the oral rehydration solution during oral rehydration therapy. A multicenter trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of Lactobacillus GG administered in the oral rehydration solution to patients with acute-onset diarrhea of all causes.
Children 1 month to 3 years of age with acute-onset diarrhea were enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled investigation. Patients were randomly allocated to group A, receiving oral rehydration solution plus placebo, or group B, receiving the same preparation but with a live preparation of Lactobacillus GG (at least 10(10) CFU/250 ml). After rehydration in the first 4 to 6 hours, patients were offered their usual feedings plus free access to the same solution until diarrhea stopped.
One hundred forty children were enrolled in group A, and 147 in group B. There were no differences at admission between the groups in age, sex, previous types of feeding, previous duration of diarrhea, use of antibiotics, weight, height, weight-height percentile, prevalence of fever, overall status, degree of dehydration, and percentage of in- versus outpatients. Duration of diarrhea after enrollment was 71.9 +/- 35.8 hours in group A versus 58.3 +/- 27.6 hours in group B (mean +/- SD; P = 0.03). In rotavirus-positive children, diarrhea lasted 76.6 +/- 41.6 hours in group A versus 56.2 +/- 16.9 hours in groups B (P < 0.008).

We set out to assess its role in preventing antibiotic-related diarrhoea. Consecutive patients over the age of 65 admitted to medical wards, and who were being prescribed antibiotics, were randomized to receive either S. boulardii 113 g twice daily or placebo for as long as they received antibiotics. Bowel habit was monitored using a record of interdefaecatory intervals (IDI) and stool form graded 1-4 (hard to liquid). Stool samples were tested every fourth day for Clostridium difficile toxin. Of the 72 patients randomized, 69 completed the study. There was no difference in sex, age, duration of antibiotic use, length of hospital stay, IDI, stool form, the proportion of patients receiving laxatives, the number of patients experiencing watery stools (seven vs. five), or the presence of C. difficile toxin (five vs. three). No side effects were attributable to S. boulardii. There was no evidence that the concomitant use of S. boulardii with antibiotics alters patients' bowel habits or prevents the appearance of C. difficile toxin in the stool. Thus, S. boulardii cannot be recommended as a 'natural' way to prevent antibiotic-related diarrhoea.

7819650,"Heimburger, Sockwell, Geels",Diarrhea with enteral feeding: prospective reappraisal of putative causes.,"Our objective was to test, in tube-fed patients whether treatment with antibiotics, the presence of hypoalbuminemia, or the use of hypertonic tube feeding is associated with a higher incidence of diarrhea; how often tube feeding actually causes diarrhea; and whether administration of a Lactobacillus preparation reduces the incidence of diarrhea. Our study design included a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of patients on tube feeding for at least 5 days. Stool weights and clinical assessment of bowel function were used as outcome measures. Diarrhea was defined as > 200 g of stool, or three or more liquid stools, in any 24-h period. The tube feeding was considered responsible for diarrhea only when the latter resolved on discontinuation of the feeding. When diarrhea did not resolve, other causes were sought. Of 62 patients enrolled, 41 reached a trial end point. Of these, 34 completed 5 days of feeding without diarrhea, and 7 experienced diarrhea. Although diarrhea was associated with hypoalbuminemia and with protracted treatment with antibiotics, in only 1 subject who had a history of gastric surgery was it caused by tube feeding. The other 6 cases of diarrhea were caused by factors other than tube feeding, mainly drugs administered through the tube. Lactobacillus treatment did not alter the risk of diarrhea.

39161074,Saetang et al.,The effectiveness of telemonitoring and integrated personalized diabetes management in people with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"To evaluate the effectiveness of integrated personalized diabetes management (iPDM) through telemedicine (tele-iPDM) with regard to glycaemic control.
A 6-month single-centre, open-label, prospective randomized controlled trial enrolled insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes, aged 18-65 years with glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels of 7.5%-10.5%. The tele-iPDM group received insulin adjustment by investigators through a cloud-based telemonitoring platform for 6 months (blood glucose monitoring reviewed weekly from Weeks 0 to 12 and then monthly from Weeks 13 to 24). The control group performed self-monitoring and insulin adjustment. The primary outcome was the difference in HbA1c change from baseline between the two groups at 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes included changes in HbA1c at 12 weeks, fasting plasma glucose, body weight, body mass index (BMI), the percentage of individuals achieving HbA1c <7% at 24 weeks, the percentage of individuals with an HbA1c reduction of >0.5% at 24 weeks, and incidences of hypoglycaemic events.
A total of 151 participants were enrolled, with a mean age of 53.36 ± 8.08 years and a mean diabetes duration of 12.38 ± 8.47 years. The baseline HbA1c was 8.47 ± 0.76%. The mean HbA1c decreased from baseline to 12 and 24 weeks in both groups. At 12 weeks, HbA1c reduction from baseline was -1.2% (95%CI -1.42 to -0.98) in the tele-iPDM group and -0.57% (95%CI -0.79 to -0.36) in the control group. The mean difference in HbA1c between the tele-iPDM and usual care groups at 12 weeks was -0.63% (95%CI -0.94 to -0.32; p < 0.001). At 24 weeks, HbA1c reduction from baseline was -1.14% (95%CI -1.38 to -0.89) in the tele-iPDM group and - 0.49% (95%CI -0.73 to -0.25) in the control group. The mean difference in HbA1c between the tele-iPDM and usual care groups was -0.65% (95%CI -0.99 to -0.30; p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in body weight, BMI, or hypoglycaemic events between the two groups.
Telemonitoring can support the iPDM care model in individuals with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes. It improves the efficiency of diabetes care, enhances glycaemic control at 12 weeks, and sustains glycaemic control at 24 weeks.","['insulin‐treated', 'structured feedback loop', 'telemedicine', 'tele‐monitoring', 'type 2 diabetes']","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",10.1111/dom.15870,2024-08-20,"[{'lastname': 'Saetang', 'firstname': 'Thanyalak', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Greeviroj', 'firstname': 'Primploy', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Thavaraputta', 'firstname': 'Subhanudh', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Santisitthanon', 'firstname': 'Prangareeya', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Houngngam', 'firstname': 'Natnicha', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Excellence center in Diabetes, Hormones and Metabolism, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Laichuthai', 'firstname': 'Nitchakarn', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.\nExcellence center in Diabetes, Hormones and Metabolism, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand.'}]",39161074,ca2a5a8d-0233-448e-84a0-d6d23766892a,,DENIED: Wiley E Publisher says no to https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/dom.15870/pdf
39049121,Berube et al.,Diabetes Telemedicine Mediterranean Diet (DiaTeleMed) Study: study protocol for a fully remote randomized clinical trial evaluating personalized dietary management in individuals with type 2 diabetes.,"The Diabetes Telemedicine Mediterranean Diet (DiaTeleMed) Study is a fully remote randomized clinical trial evaluating personalized dietary management in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The study aims to test the efficacy of a personalized behavioral approach for dietary management of moderately controlled T2D, versus a standardized behavioral intervention that uses one-size-fits-all dietary recommendations, versus a usual care control (UCC). The primary outcome will compare the impact of each intervention on the mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE).
Eligible participants are between 21 and 80 years of age diagnosed with moderately controlled T2D (HbA1c: 6.0 to 8.0%) and managed on lifestyle alone or lifestyle plus metformin. Participants must be willing and able to attend virtual counseling sessions and log meals into a dietary tracking smartphone application (DayTwo), and wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) for up to 12 days. Participants are randomized with equal allocation (n = 255, n = 85 per arm) to one of three arms: (1) Personalized, (2) Standardized, or (3) UCC. Measurements occur at 0 (baseline), 3, and 6 months. All participants receive isocaloric energy and macronutrient targets to meet Mediterranean diet guidelines, in addition to 14 intervention contacts over 6 months (4 weekly then 10 biweekly) to cover diabetes self-management education. The first 4 UCC intervention contacts are delivered via synchronous videoconferences followed by educational video links. Participants in Standardized receive the same educational content as those in the UCC arm, following the same schedule. However, all intervention contacts are conducted via synchronous videoconferences, paired with Social Cognitive Theory (SCT)-based behavioral counseling, plus dietary self-monitoring of planned meals using a mobile app that provides real-time feedback on calories and macronutrients. Participants in the Personalized arm receive all elements of the Standardized intervention, in addition to real-time feedback on predicted post-prandial glycemic response (PPGR) to meals and snacks logged into the mobile app.
The DiaTeleMed Study aims to address an important gap in the current landscape of precision nutrition by determining the contributions of behavioral counseling and personalized nutrition recommendations on glycemic control in individuals with T2D. The fully remote methodology of the study allows for scalability and innovative delivery of personalized dietary recommendations at a population level.

38780107,Alfarwan et al.,Clinical and cost-effectiveness of telemedicine among patients with type 2 diabetes in primary care: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Telemedicine has been promoted as an effective way of managing type-2 diabetes (T2DM) in primary care. However, the effectiveness of telemedicine is unclear. We investigated the clinical and cost-effectiveness of different telemedicine interventions for people with T2DM, compared to usual care.
We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane, CINHAL, ProQuest and EconLit for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the effectiveness of telemedicine interventions on clinical outcomes (HbA1c, body mass index [BMI], weight, diastolic blood pressure [DBP], systolic blood pressure [SBP], fasting blood glucose, high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglyceride) in adults with T2DM, published in English from inception until 31 December 2022. Meta-analyses were conducted using random-effects models pooling mean differences, heterogeneity was quantified using the I
Of the 4093 records identified, 21 RCTs, 10,732 participants from seven regions, were included. Reported interventions included telephone (k = 16 studies), internet-based (k = 2), videoconference (k = 2) and telephone and emails (k = 1). We observed no statistically significant differences between synchronous or asynchronous telemedicine interventions compared to usual care for HbA1c (-0.08% (-0.88 mmol/mol); 95% CI: -0.18, 0.02), BMI (0.51 kg/m
Telemedicine was as effective as usual care in improving health outcomes of people with T2DM. They can provide a safe solution in times of rising demands for primary healthcare services, or in extreme events, like a global pandemic. More high-quality RCTs are needed on the cost evaluation of telemedicine.","['primary health care', 'telemedicine', 'type 2 diabetes']",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,10.1111/dme.15343,2024-05-23,"[{'lastname': 'Alfarwan', 'firstname': 'Nawwarah', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Division of Informatics, Imaging & Data Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, School of Health Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Hodkinson', 'firstname': 'Alexander', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Division of Population Health, Health Services Research and Primary Care, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, School of Health Sciences, National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) School for Primary Care Research, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.\nDivision of Population Health, Health Services Research and Primary Care, National Institute for Health Research Greater Manchester Patient Safety Translational Research Centre, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Panagioti', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Division of Population Health, Health Services Research and Primary Care, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, School of Health Sciences, National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) School for Primary Care Research, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.\nDivision of Population Health, Health Services Research and Primary Care, National Institute for Health Research Greater Manchester Patient Safety Translational Research Centre, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Hassan', 'firstname': 'Lamiece', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Division of Psychology and Mental Health, The University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Kontopantelis', 'firstname': 'Evangelos', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Division of Informatics, Imaging & Data Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, School of Health Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.\nDivision of Population Health, Health Services Research and Primary Care, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, School of Health Sciences, National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) School for Primary Care Research, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.'}]",38780107,ca2a5a8d-0233-448e-84a0-d6d23766892a,,DENIED: Wiley E Publisher says no to https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/dme.15343/pdf
38467918,Patel et al.,A Randomized Controlled Trial to Improve Unmet Social Needs and Clinical Outcomes Among Adults with Diabetes.,"Adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes often face financial challenges and other unmet social needs to effective diabetes self-management.
Whether a digital intervention focused on addressing socioeconomic determinants of health improves diabetes clinical outcomes more than usual care.
Randomized trial from 2019 to 2023.
A total of 600 adults with diabetes, HbA1c ≥ 7.5%, and self-reported unmet social needs or financial burden from a health system and randomized to the intervention or standard care.
CareAvenue is an automated, e-health intervention with eight videos that address unmet social needs contributing to poor outcomes.
Primary outcome was HbA1c, measured at baseline, and 6 and 12 months after randomization. Secondary outcomes included systolic blood pressure and reported met social needs, cost-related non-adherence (CRN), and financial burden. We examined main effects and variation in effects across predefined subgroups.
Seventy-eight percent of CareAvenue participants completed one or more modules of the website. At 12-month follow-up, there were no significant differences in HbA1c changes between CareAvenue and control group (p = 0.24). There were also no significant between-group differences in systolic blood pressure (p = 0.29), met social needs (p = 0.25), CRN (p = 0.18), and perceived financial burden (p = 0.31). In subgroup analyses, participants with household incomes 100-400% FPL (1.93 (SE = 0.76), p < 0.01), 201-400% FPL (1.30 (SE = 0.62), p < 0.04), and > 400% FPL (1.27 (SE = 0.64), p < 0.05) had significantly less A1c decreases compared to the control group.
On average, CareAvenue participants did not achieve better A1c lowering, met needs, CRN, or perceived financial burden compared to control participants. CareAvenue participants with higher incomes achieved significantly less A1c reductions than control. Further research is needed on social needs interventions that consider tailored approaches to population subgroups.

38055278,Zupa et al.,Patterns of Telemedicine Use and Glycemic Outcomes of Endocrinology Care for Patients With Type 2 Diabetes.,"Telemedicine can increase access to endocrinology care for people with type 2 diabetes (T2D), but patterns of use and outcomes of telemedicine specialty care for adults with T2D beyond initial uptake in 2020 are not known.
To evaluate patterns of telemedicine use and their association with glycemic control among adults with varying clinical complexity receiving endocrinology care for T2D.
Retrospective cohort study in a single large integrated US health system. Participants were adults who had a telemedicine endocrinology visit for T2D from May to October 2020. Data were analyzed from June 2022 to October 2023.
Patients were followed up through May 2022 and assigned to telemedicine-only, in-person, or mixed care (both telemedicine and in-person) cohorts according to visit modality.
Multivariable regression models were used to estimate hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) change at 12 months within each cohort and the association of factors indicating clinical complexity (insulin regimen and cardiovascular and psychological comorbidities) with HbA1c change across cohorts. Subgroup analysis was performed for patients with baseline HbA1c of 8% or higher.
Of 11 498 potentially eligible patients, 3778 were included in the final cohort (81 Asian participants [2%], 300 Black participants [8%], and 3332 White participants [88%]); 1182 used telemedicine only (mean [SD] age 57.4 [12.9] years; 743 female participants [63%]), 1049 used in-person care (mean [SD] age 63.0 [12.2] years; 577 female participants [55%]), and 1547 used mixed care (mean [SD] age 60.7 [12.5] years; 881 female participants [57%]). Among telemedicine-only patients, there was no significant change in adjusted HbA1c at 12 months (-0.06%; 95% CI, -0.26% to 0.14%; P = .55) while in-person and mixed cohorts had improvements of 0.37% (95% CI, 0.15% to 0.59%; P < .001) and 0.22% (95% CI, 0.07% to 0.38%; P = .004), respectively. Patients with a baseline HbA1c of 8% or higher had a similar pattern of glycemic outcomes. For patients prescribed multiple daily injections vs no insulin, the 12-month estimated change in HbA1c was 0.25% higher (95% CI, 0.02% to 0.47%; P = .03) for telemedicine vs in-person care. Comorbidities were not associated with HbA1c change in any cohort.
In this cohort study of adults with T2D receiving endocrinology care, patients using telemedicine alone had inferior glycemic outcomes compared with patients who used in-person or mixed care. Additional strategies may be needed to support adults with T2D who rely on telemedicine alone to access endocrinology care, especially for those with complex treatment or elevated HbA1c.",[],JAMA network open,"10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.46305

37995967,Zamanillo-Campos et al.,"DiabeText, a mobile health intervention to support medication taking and healthy lifestyle in adults with type 2 diabetes: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.","To evaluate the effectiveness of DiabeText, a low-intensity, multifaceted, mobile health (mHealth) intervention to support medication taking and lifestyle change targeted to people with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
Phase III, 12-months, two-arm (1:1 allocation ratio), randomized parallel-group trial.
We will recruit 740 adults with glycated hemoglobin (A1c) >8% (>64 mmol/mol) and with at least one prescription of a non-insulin antidiabetic drug. They will be allocated to a control (usual care) group or an intervention (DiabeText messaging intervention) group. The primary outcome measure will be A1c at 12 months follow-up. Secondary outcomes will include medication possession ratio and behavioral and psychological outcomes.
Recent trials suggest that digital health interventions can effectively support diabetes self-management improving T2D control and reducing important T2D complications. In Spain this type of interventions is understudied.
This trial will strengthen the evidence base of the impact of mHealth interventions to support diabetes self-management. If effective, DiabeText may offer a low-cost and highly scalable strategy to improve health at the population level in a sustainable way.

37803098,Vaughan et al.,Implementation and Evaluation of a mHealth-Based Community Health Worker Feedback Loop for Hispanics with and at Risk for Diabetes.,"Gaps in accessibility and communication hinder diabetes care in poor communities. Combining mobile health (mHealth) and community health workers (CHWs) into models to bridge these gaps has great potential but needs evaluation.
To evaluate a mHealth-based, Participant-CHW-Clinician feedback loop in a real-world setting.
Quasi-experimental feasibility study with intervention and usual care (UC) groups.
A total of 134 participants (n = 67/group) who were all low-income, uninsured Hispanics with or at-risk for type 2 diabetes.
A 15-month study with a weekly to semimonthly mHealth Participant-CHW-Clinician feedback loop to identify participant issues and provide participants monthly diabetes education via YouTube.
We used pre-defined feasibility measures to evaluate our intervention: (a) implementation, the execution of feedback loops to identify and resolve participant issues, and (b) efficacy, intended effects of the program on clinical outcomes (baseline to 15-month HbA1c, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and weight changes) for each group and their subgroups (at-risk; with diabetes, including uncontrolled (HbA1c ≥ 7%)).
CHWs identified 433 participant issues (mean = 6.5 ± 5.3) and resolved 91.9% of these. Most issues were related to supplies, 26.3% (n = 114); physical health, 23.1% (n = 100); and medication access, 20.8% (n = 90). Intervention participants significantly improved HbA1c (- 0.51%, p = 0.03); UC did not (- 0.10%, p = 0.76). UC DBP worsened (1.91 mmHg, p < 0.01). Subgroup analyses revealed HbA1c improvements for uncontrolled diabetes (intervention: - 1.59%, p < 0.01; controlled: - 0.72, p = 0.03). Several variables for UC at-risk participants worsened: HbA1c (0.25%, p < 0.01), SBP (4.05 mmHg, p < 0.01), DBP (3.21 mmHg, p = 0.01). There were no other significant changes for either group.
A novel mHealth-based, Participant-CHW-Clinician feedback loop was associated with improved HbA1c levels and identification and resolution of participant issues. UC individuals had several areas of clinical deterioration, particularly those at-risk for diabetes, which is concerning for progression to diabetes and disease-related complications.

37726978,Shao et al.,Telehealth use and its impact on clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"To evaluate the impact of telehealth use during the COVID-19 pandemic on glycaemic control and other clinical outcomes among patients with type 2 diabetes.
We used electronic health records from the Research Action for Health Network (REACHnet) database for patients with type 2 diabetes who had telehealth visits and those who only received in-person care during the pandemic. A quasi-experimental method of difference-in-difference with propensity-score weighting was implemented to mitigate selection bias and to control for observed factors related to telehealth use. Outcomes included glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and other clinical measures (low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol, blood pressure [BP], and body mass index [BMI]).
Patients using telehealth had better HbA1c control compared to those receiving in-person care only during the pandemic. The telehealth group saw a significant average decrease of 0.146% (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.178% to -0.1145%; P < 0.001) in HbA1c levels over time. The proportion of patients with average HbA1c levels >7% decreased by 0.023 (95% CI -0.034, -0.011; P < 0.001) in the treatment group relative to the comparison group. Modest benefits in the control of LDL cholesterol levels, diastolic BP, and BMI were found in association with telehealth use.
Our findings suggest that telehealth services contributed to better glycaemic control and management of other clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes during the pandemic. Factors unmeasured in this study would need to be further explored to better understand the impact of telehealth.","['cohort study', 'effectiveness', 'glycaemic control', 'primary care', 'real-world evidence', 'type 2 diabetes']","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",10.1111/dom.15293,2023-09-20,"[{'lastname': 'Shao', 'firstname': 'Yixue', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Policy and Management, Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Shi', 'firstname': 'Lizheng', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Policy and Management, Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Nauman', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Louisiana Public Health Institute, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Price-Haywood', 'firstname': 'Eboni', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Ochsner Health System, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Stoecker', 'firstname': 'Charles', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Policy and Management, Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.'}]",37726978,ca2a5a8d-0233-448e-84a0-d6d23766892a,,DENIED: Wiley E Publisher says no to https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/dom.15293/pdf
37267809,Zamanillo-Campos et al.,"Development and evaluation of DiabeText, a personalized mHealth intervention to support medication adherence and lifestyle change behaviour in patients with type 2 diabetes in Spain: A mixed-methods phase II pragmatic randomized controlled clinical trial.","Despite the increasing interest in text-messaging interventions to support healthcare delivery, the available evidence about their effectiveness is still limited.
1) to develop DiabeText, an intervention delivering automated, tailored brief text messages to support diabetes self-management; 2) to explore the potential impact of DiabeText on self-management behavior and glycaemic control, and; 3) to examine the feasibility of conducting a future phase III randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of DiabeText.
3-month, two-arm, randomized feasibility trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04738591) with patients with type 2 diabetes (HbA1c > 8%). Participants were allocated to the control (usual care) or DiabeText group (usual care + five text messages per week). Outcomes were: recruitment rate; follow-up rate, missing data; medication adherence; adherence to Mediterranean diet; physical activity; and HbA1c. In addition, after delivering the intervention, we conducted a qualitative study involving 14 semi-structured interviews with participants allocated to the DiabeText group, to understand their views about the intervention.
From 444 screened people, we recruited 207 participants (recruitment rate = 47%), of which 179 completed the post-intervention interview (follow-up rate = 86%). We sent 7,355 SMS during the intervention period, of which 99% successfully reached the participants. At post-intervention, DiabeText was associated with non-statistically significant (p > 0.05) improvements in adherence to medication (OR = 2.0; 95%CI 1.0 to 4.2), Mediterranean diet (1.7; 0.9 to 3.2), and physical activity (1.7; 0.9 to 3.1). No between-group differences were observed in mean HbA1c (p = 0.670). The qualitative study indicated that participants perceived DiabeText as a helpful resource because it increased their awareness about the importance of adequate self-management and the sense of being cared for.
DiabeText is the first system in Spain to integrate patient-generated and routinely collected clinical data to deliver tailored text messages to support diabetes self-management. More robust trials are needed to determine its effectiveness and cost-efficacy.","['Diabetes self-management', 'Glycemic control', 'Lifestyle behaviour', 'Mobile health', 'Randomized controlled trial', 'SMS', 'Treatment adherence', 'Type 2 diabetes mellitus', 'mHealth']",International journal of medical informatics,10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2023.105103,2023-06-03,"[{'lastname': 'Zamanillo-Campos', 'firstname': 'Rocío', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': ""Balearic Islands Health Research Institute (IdISBa) Carretera de Valldemossa, 79, Hospital Universitari Son Espases.

37214251,Zhang et al.,Effects of E-health-based interventions on glycemic control for patients with type 2 diabetes: a Bayesian network meta-analysis.,"The high disease burden of type 2 diabetes seriously affects the quality of life of patients, and with the deep integration of the Internet and healthcare, the application of electronic tools and information technology to has become a trend for disease management. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of different forms and durations of E-health interventions in achieving glycemic control in type 2 diabetes patients. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Clinical Trials.gov were searched for randomized controlled trials reporting different forms of E-health intervention for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes patients, including comprehensive measures (CM), smartphone applications (SA), phone calls (PC), short message service (SMS), websites (W), wearable devices (WD), and usual care. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) adults (age≥18) with type 2 diabetes mellitus; (2) intervention period ≥1 month; (3) outcome HbA1c (%); and (4) randomized control of E-health based approaches. Cochrane tools were used to assess the risk of bias. R 4.1.2 was used to conduct the Bayesian network meta-analysis. A total of 88 studies with 13,972 type 2 diabetes patients were included. Compared to the usual care group, the SMS-based intervention was superior in reducing HbA1c levels (mean difference (MD)-0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.82 to -0.31), followed by SA (MD-0.45, 95% CI: -0.61 to -0.30), CM (MD-0.41, 95% CI: -0.57 to -0.25), W (MD-0.39, 95% CI: -0.60 to -0.18) and PC (MD-0.32, 95% CI: -0.50 to -0.14) (p < 0.05). Subgroup analysis revealed that intervention durations of ≤6 months were most effective. All type of E-health based approaches can improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. SMS is a high-frequency, low-barrier technology that achieves the best effect in lowering HbA1c, with ≤6 months being the optimal intervention duration.

36939825,Feng et al.,The Effectiveness of an eHealth Family-Based Intervention Program in Patients With Uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in the Community Via WeChat: Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Intervention based on family support and risk perception can enhance type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients' self-care activities. In addition, eHealth education is considered to improve family members' support for patients with T2DM. However, there is little evidence from rigorously designed studies on the effectiveness of an intervention combining these approaches.
This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to assess the effectiveness of an eHealth family-based health education intervention for patients with T2DM to improve their glucose control, risk perception, and self-care behaviors.
This single-center, 2-parallel-group RCT was conducted between 2019 and 2020. Overall, 228 patients were recruited from Jiading District, Shanghai, and randomly divided into intervention and control groups. The intervention group received an eHealth family intervention based on community management via WeChat, whereas the control group received usual care. The primary outcome was the glycated hemoglobin (HbA
In total, 225 patients with T2DM were followed up for 1 year. After intervention, they had significantly lower HbA
The eHealth family-based intervention improved glucose control and self-care activities among patients with T2DM by aiding the implementation of interventions to improve T2DM risk perceptions among family members. The intervention is generalizable for patients with T2DM using health management systems in community health centers.

36822665,Zhang et al.,Effectiveness of synchronous teleconsultation for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The popularity of teleconsultation during the COVID-19 pandemic enabled increased accessibility for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, previous studies did not distinguish between synchronous and asynchronous teleconsultation. We evaluated the effectiveness of synchronous teleconsultation for patients with T2DM. We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Library and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform databases from inception to July 2021. All included studies were randomized controlled trials of synchronous teleconsultation for adults with T2DM compared with usual care. Reviewers independently extracted data and used the Cochrane tool to evaluate risk of bias. Meta-analyses were conducted using random-effects models.

36817609,Al-Mutairi et al.,Impact of telemedicine on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus during the COVID-19 lockdown period.,"The lockdown at the start of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Saudi Arabia (March 2020 to June 2020) shifted routine in-person care for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to telemedicine. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact telemedicine had during this period on glycemic control (HbA1c) in patients with T2DM.
4,266 patients with T2DM were screened from five Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs hospitals in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Age, gender, body mass index (BMI), HbA1c (before and after the COVID-19 lockdown), duration of T2DM, comorbidities and antidiabetic medications data were obtained. Mean and standard deviation of differences in HbA1c were calculated to assess the impact of telemedicine intervention. Correlations between clinically significant variances (when change in the level is ≥0.5%) in HbA1c with demographics and clinical characteristic data were determined using chi square test.
Most of the participants were Saudis (97.7%) with 59.7% female and 56.4% ≥60 years of age. Obesity was 63.8%, dyslipidemia 91%, and hypertension 70%. Mean HbA1c of all patients slightly rose from 8.52% ± 1.5% before lockdown to 8.68% ± 1.6% after lockdown. There were n=1,064 patients (24.9%) whose HbA1c decreased by ≥0.5%, n =1,574 patients whose HbA1c increased by ≥0.5% (36.9%), and n =1,628 patients whose HbA1c changed by <0.5% in either direction (38.2%). More males had significant improvements in glycemia compared to females (28.1% vs 22.8%, p<0.0001), as were individuals below the age of 60 years (28.1% vs 22.5%, p<0.0001). Hypertensive individuals were less likely than non-hypertensive to have glycemic improvement (23.7% vs 27.9%, p=0.015). More patients on sulfonylureas had improvements in HbA1c (42.3% vs 37.9%, p=0.032), whereas patients on insulin had higher HbA1c (62.7% vs 56.2%, p=0.001). HbA1c changes were independent of BMI, duration of disease, hyperlipidemia, heart and kidney diseases.
Telemedicine was helpful in delivering care to T2DM patients during COVID-19 lockdown, with 63.1% of patients maintaining HbA1c and improving glycemia. More males than females showed improvements. However, the HbA1c levels in this cohort of patients pre- and post-lockdown were unsatisfactorily high, and may be due to in part lifestyle, age, education, and hypertension.","['COVID-19', 'diabetes mellitus', 'glycated hemoglobin A1c', 'lockdown', 'telemedicine']",Frontiers in endocrinology,"10.3389/fendo.2023.1068018

36649940,Lee et al.,Effects of mobile health interventions on health-related outcomes in older adults with type 2 diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic condition that is associated with multiple comorbidities. Apart from pharmacological approaches, patient self-management remains the gold standard of care for diabetes. Improving patients' self-management among the elderly with mobile health (mHealth) interventions is critical, especially in times of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the extent of mHealth efficacy in managing T2DM in the older population remains unknown. Hence, the present review examined the effectiveness of mHealth interventions on cardiometabolic outcomes in older adults with T2DM.
A systematic search from the inception till May 31, 2021, in the MEDLINE, Embase, and PubMed databases was conducted, and 16 randomized controlled trials were included in the analysis.
The results showed significant benefits on glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (mean difference -0.24%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.44, -0.05; p = 0.01), postprandial blood glucose (-2.91 mmol/L; 95% CI: -4.78, -1.03; p = 0.002), and triglycerides (-0.09 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.17, -0.02; p = 0.010), but not on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-0.06 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.14, 0.02; p = 0.170), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.05 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.03, 0.13; p = 0.220), and blood pressure (systolic blood pressure -0.82 mm Hg; 95% CI: -4.65, 3.00; p = 0.670; diastolic blood pressure -1.71 mmHg; 95% CI: -3.71, 0.29; p = 0.090).
Among older adults with T2DM, mHealth interventions were associated with improved cardiometabolic outcomes versus usual care. Its efficacy can be improved in the future as the current stage of mHealth development is at its infancy. Addressing barriers such as technological frustrations may help strategize approaches to further increase the uptake and efficacy of mHealth interventions among older adults with T2DM.

36476605,Hangaard et al.,The Diabetes teleMonitoring of patients in insulin Therapy (DiaMonT) trial: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"The effect of telemedicine solutions in diabetes remains inconclusive. However, telemedicine studies have shown a positive trend in regards to glycemic control. The telemedicine interventions that facilitate adjustment of medication seems to improve glycemic control more effectively. Hence, it is recommended that future telemedicine studies for patients with diabetes include patient-specific suggestions for changes in medicine. Hence, the aim of the trial is to explore the effect of telemonitoring in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) on insulin therapy.
The trial is an open-label randomized controlled trial with a trial period of 3 months conducted in two sites in Denmark. Patients with T2D on insulin therapy will be randomized (1:1) to a telemonitoring group (intervention) or a usual care group (control). The telemonitoring group will use a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), an insulin pen, an activity tracker, and smartphone applications throughout the trial. Hospital staff will monitor the telemonitoring group and contact the subjects by telephone repeatedly throughout the trial period. The usual care group will use a blinded CGM the first and last 20 days of the trial and will use a blinded insulin pen for the entire period. The primary endpoint will be changed from baseline in CGM time in range (3.9-10.0 mmol/L) 3 months after randomization. Secondary endpoints include change from baseline in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), total daily dose, time above range, and time below range 3 months after randomization. Exploratory endpoints include health-related quality of life, diabetes-related quality of life, etc. DISCUSSION: The DiaMonT trial will test a telemonitoring setup including various devices. Such a setup may be criticized, because it is impossible to determine which element(s) add to the potential effect. However, it is not possible and counterproductive to test the elements individually, since it is the full telemedicine setup that is being evaluated. The DiaMonT trial is the first Danish trial to explore the effect of telemonitoring on patients on insulin therapy. Thus, the DiaMonT trial has the potential to form the basis for the implementation of telemedicine for patients with T2D in Denmark.

In an RCT, 170 patients were enrolled from 2018 to 2019 for intervention or control. Inclusion criteria were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, BMI 30−45 kg/m2, and aged 18−70 years. Exclusion criteria were lacks internet access, pregnant or planning a pregnancy, or has a serious disease. Primary and secondary outcomes were a reduction in body weight and HbA1c. At six months, 75 (75%) patients in the intervention group and 53 (76%) patients in the control group remained in the trial. The mean body weight loss was 4.2 kg (95% CI, −5.49; −2.98) in the intervention group and 1.5 kg (95% CI, −2.57; −0.48) in the control group (p = 0.005). In the intervention group, 24 out of 62 patients with elevated HbA1c at baseline (39%) had a normalized HbA1c < 6.5% at six months, compared to 8 out of 40 patients with elevated HbA1c at baseline (20%) in the control group (p = 0.047). The eHealth lifestyle coaching programme can lead to significant weight loss and decreased HbA1c among patients with type 2 diabetes, compared to standard care.","['digital behavioural coaching', 'health behaviour change', 'interactive advice', 'lifestyle change', 'mobile intervention', 'obesity', 'participant engagement', 'quality of life', 'telemedicine']",Nutrients,"10.3390/nu14163424

35899952,Henderson et al.,Systematic Review of the Frequency of Registered Dietitian-Nutritionist Intervention in the Primary Care Setting for Diabetes Self-Management Education for Patients with Type II Diabetes.,"The purpose of this systematic review is to discuss the ideal frequency of Registered Dietitian-Nutritionist (RDN) contact required to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes in the primary care setting.
Researchers completed a literature search between April 1 and June 30, 2020. Researchers identified 184 studies and included seven studies for full-text analysis. Eligible studies were required to occur in a primary care setting, use A1C as an outcome measure, and use some form of education or contact with an RDN. Study quality was assessed using the NIH Study Quality Assessment Tool.
Compared to the usual care group of each study, increased contact with an RDN improved A1C lowering regardless of frequency (round-the-clock, monthly, biannually). The largest decreases occurred in the round-the-clockand quarterly touch groups. Studies varied in modality (inperson, telehealth, etc.) and type of intervention. The participants had A1Cs between 8.07% and 10.25% before intervention. With RDN contact of any frequency between provider visits and participants saw A1Cs decreased between 0.66% and 2.2%.
Greater glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes in the primary care environment is linked to more frequent RDN contact than that advised by the American Diabetes Association Standards of Care.","['Diabetes', 'MNT', 'diabetes educator', 'dietetics', 'dietitian', 'medical nutrition therapy', 'nutrition', 'nutritionist', 'registered dietitian-nutritionist', 'type 2 diabetes', 'type II diabetes']",Current diabetes reviews,10.2174/1573399819666220721113103,2022-07-29,"[{'lastname': 'Henderson', 'firstname': 'Dana', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center, Richmond, VA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Salmons', 'firstname': 'Hannah', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center, Richmond, VA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Winston', 'firstname': 'Paris', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center, Richmond, VA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Koehn', 'firstname': 'Deborah A', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center, Richmond, VA, United States.'}]",35899952,ca2a5a8d-0233-448e-84a0-d6d23766892a,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Curr Diabetes Rev"""
35700926,María Gómez et al.,Efficacy of the mHealth application in patients with type 2 diabetes transitioning from inpatient to outpatient care: A randomized controlled clinical trial.,"No studies have assessed the efficacy of telemedicine using a platform for recording and adjusting insulin doses in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) transitioning from inpatient to outpatient care. This study aimed to assess, in a population of patients with DM2, discharged from a tertiary referral hospital, whether treatment based on the use of an mHealth application was associated with better glycemic control at the 3-month follow-up, than standard care.
This open, randomized, controlled clinical trial included adult DM2 patients who were transitioning from inpatient to outpatient care. The efficacy and safety of patient management with and without mHealth was compared at the 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome was the change in the Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. The secondary outcomes were the rates of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events and treatment satisfaction measured using the Insulin Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (ITSQ).
In total, 86 patients (41 using mHealth) were included in the clinical trial. HbA1c levels showed a significant decrease in both groups. The mean HbA1c level was significantly lower in the mHealth group. Patients using mHealth showed decreased incidence rate ratios of hypoglycemia 3.0 mmol/L [<54 mg/dl], hypoglycemia ranging from 3.0 to 3.8 mmol/L [54 to 70 mg/dl] and severe hypoglycemia. The level of satisfaction assessed using the ITSQ was higher in the mHealth group.
Using mHealth in patients with DM2 transitioning from inpatient to outpatient care improves metabolic control and may reduce the hypoglycemia rates.","['ClouDi', 'Hospital', 'Telemedicine', 'Type 2 diabetes', 'mHealth']",Diabetes research and clinical practice,10.1016/j.diabres.2022.109948,2022-06-15,"[{'lastname': 'María Gómez', 'firstname': 'Ana', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Endocrinology Unit, Hospital Universitario San Ignacio, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Carrera 7 No. 40-62, Bogotá, Colombia.

35619303,Tristão et al.,Telemedicine for Diabetes Mellitus Management in Older Adults: A Systematic Review.,"Diabetes mellitus affects almost 20% of the world's population between 65 and 99 years old. The care for this disease urges a complex, multidisciplinary, and stepwise approach. Telemedicine has been evaluated, and clinical trials as well as systematic reviews have been performed, and most have shown the benefits of its use in DM management. However, as the prevalence of diabetes mellitus increases, as well as the population ages, considerations regarding access and compliance of older patients to such technologies arise.
The study aimed to determine the efficacy of telemedicine medical consultations in comparison to standard face-to-face consultations.
A systematic literature search to identify trials investigating the effect of telemedicine medical consultations in clinical-laboratory aspects of DM management was conducted. The search was carried out in electronic databases: Medline, EMBASE, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the CENTRAL Cochrane. Two authors independently assessed the included studies using the proper bias assessment tool for each study design.
In agreement with the eligibility criteria, three studies were included. In terms of the main outcome, HbA1c, only one out of three articles showed a significant difference between the groups, favoring patients in the telemedicine group. With respect to blood pressure, Sood A reported that the usual care group exhibited a greater improvement in systolic blood pressure with statistical differences. All other results displayed no significant statistical difference between the groups. Also, no statistical difference was found in most of the lipid profile results.
Our review shows that teleconsultations do not provide a clear benefit to elderly people with diabetes, but they may be non-inferior.","['Telemedicine', 'blood pressure', 'body mass index', 'diabetes mellitus', 'elderly', 'glycated hemoglobin', 'systematic review']",Current diabetes reviews,10.2174/1573399818666220519164605,2022-05-28,"[{'lastname': 'Tristão', 'firstname': 'Luca Schiliró', 'initials': 'LS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Evidence-Based Medicine, Faculdade de Ciências Médicas de Santos, Centro Universitário Lusíada, Santos-SP, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Tavares', 'firstname': 'Guilherme', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Evidence-Based Medicine, Faculdade de Ciências Médicas de Santos, Centro Universitário Lusíada, Santos-SP, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Tustumi', 'firstname': 'Francisco', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Evidence-Based Medicine, Faculdade de Ciências Médicas de Santos, Centro Universitário Lusíada, Santos-SP, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Bernardo', 'firstname': 'Wanderley Marques', 'initials': 'WM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Evidence-Based Medicine, Faculdade de Ciências Médicas de Santos, Centro Universitário Lusíada, Santos-SP, Brasil.\nUniversidade de São Paulo, São Paulo-SP, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Duarte', 'firstname': 'Márcio Luis', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': 'Webimagem - Serviço de teleradiologia, São Paulo-SP, Brasil.\nDepartamento de Medicina Interna, Programa de Saúde Baseada em Evidências, Universidade Federal de São Paulo, Centro Cochrane do Brasil, São Paulo-SP, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Peccin', 'firstname': 'Maria Stella', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Medicina Interna, Programa de Saúde Baseada em Evidências, Universidade Federal de São Paulo, Centro Cochrane do Brasil, São Paulo-SP, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Dos Santos', 'firstname': 'Lucas Ribeiro', 'initials': 'LR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Evidence-Based Medicine, Faculdade de Ciências Médicas de Santos, Centro Universitário Lusíada, Santos-SP, Brasil.'}]",35619303,ca2a5a8d-0233-448e-84a0-d6d23766892a,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Curr Diabetes Rev"""

35507345,Woodard et al.,Comparison of Collaborative Goal Setting With Enhanced Education for Managing Diabetes-Associated Distress and Hemoglobin A1c Levels: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Type 2 diabetes is a prevalent and morbid condition. Poor engagement with self-management can contribute to diabetes-associated distress and hinder diabetes control.
To evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of Empowering Patients in Chronic Care (EPICC), an evidence-based intervention to improve diabetes-associated distress and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels after the intervention and after 6-month maintenance.
This hybrid (implementation-effectiveness) randomized clinical trial was performed in Veterans Affairs clinics across Illinois, Indiana, and Texas from July 1, 2015, to June 30, 2017. Participants included adults with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (HbA1c level >8.0%) who received primary care during the prior year in participating clinics. Data collection was completed on November 30, 2018, and data analysis was completed on June 30, 2020. All analyses were based on intention to treat.
Participants in EPICC attended 6 group sessions based on a collaborative goal-setting theory led by health care professionals. Clinicians conducted individual motivational interviewing sessions after each group. Usual care was enhanced (EUC) with diabetes education.
The primary outcome consisted of changes in HbA1c levels after the intervention and during maintenance. Secondary outcomes included the Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS), Morisky Medication Adherence Scale, and Lorig Self-efficacy Scale. Secondary implementation outcomes included reach, adoption, and implementation (number of sessions attended per patient).
A total of 280 participants with type 2 diabetes (mean [SD] age, 67.2 [8.4] years; 264 men [94.3]; 134 non-Hispanic White individuals [47.9%]) were equally randomized to EPICC or EUC. Participants receiving EPICC had significant postintervention improvements in HbA1c levels (F1, 252 = 9.12, Cohen d = 0.36 [95% CI, 0.12-0.59]; P = .003) and DDS (F1, 245 = 9.06, Cohen d = 0.37 [95% CI, 0.13-0.60]; P = .003) compared with EUC. During maintenance, differences between the EUC and EPICC groups remained significant for DDS score (F1, 245 = 8.94, Cohen d = 0.36 [95% CI, 0.12-0.59]; P = .003) but not for HbA1c levels (F1, 252 = 0.29, Cohen d = 0.06 [95% CI, -0.17 to 0.30]; P = .60). Improvements in DDS scores were modest. There were no differences between EPICC and EUC in improvements after intervention or maintenance for either adherence or self-efficacy. Among all 4002 eligible patients, 280 (7.0%) enrolled in the study (reach). Each clinic conducted all planned EPICC sessions and cohorts (100% adoption). The EPICC group participants attended a mean (SD) of 4.34 (1.98) sessions, with 54 (38.6%) receiving all 6 sessions.
A patient-empowerment approach using longitudinal collaborative goal setting and motivational interviewing is feasible in primary care. Improvements in HbA1c levels after the intervention were not sustained after maintenance. Modest improvements in diabetes-associated distress after the intervention were sustained after maintenance. Innovations to expand reach (eg, telemedicine-enabled shared appointments) and sustainability are needed.

35151522,Katula et al.,Effects of a Digital Diabetes Prevention Program: An RCT.,"In light of the need to expand the reach and access of clinically proven digital Diabetes Prevention Programs (d-DPPs) and the need for rigorous evidence of effectiveness, the purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a digital Diabetes Prevention Program for improving weight, HbA1c, and cardiovascular risk factors among people with prediabetes compared to enhanced standard care plus waitlist control.
This was a single-blind RCT among participants at risk of developing type 2 diabetes and included 12 months of follow-up.
A total of 599 volunteer patients with prediabetes were recruited primarily through electronic medical records and primary care practices.
Participants were randomized to either a d-DPP (n=299) or a single-session small-group diabetes-prevention education class (n=300) focused on action planning for weight loss. The d-DPPs consisted of 52 weekly sessions, lifestyle coaching, virtual peer support, and behavior tracking tools.
The primary outcome was a change in HbA1c from baseline to 12 months using intent-to-treat analyses. On the basis of multiple comparisons of endpoints, 95% CIs are presented and 2-sided p<0.025 was required for statistical significance. Secondary outcomes included body weight and cardiovascular disease risk factors.
Among 599 randomized participants (mean age=55.4 years, 61.4% women), 483 (80%) completed the study. The d-DPPs produced significantly greater reductions in HbA1c (0.08%, 95% CI= -0.12, -0.03) and percentage change in body weight (-5.5% vs -2.1%, p<0.001) at 12 months. A greater proportion of the d-DPPs group achieved a clinically significant weight loss ≥5% (43% vs 21%, p<0.001), and more participants shifted from prediabetes to normal HbA1c range (58% vs 48%, p=0.04). Engagement in d-DPPs was significantly related to improved HbA1c and weight loss.
This d-DPPs demonstrated clinical effectiveness and has significant potential for widespread dissemination and impact, particularly considering the growing demand for telemedicine in preventive healthcare services.

35090520,Philis-Tsimikas et al.,Dulce Digital-Me: protocol for a randomized controlled trial of an adaptive mHealth intervention for underserved Hispanics with diabetes.,"By 2034, the number of US individuals with diabetes is predicted to increase from 23.7 to 44.1 million, and annual diabetes-related spending is expected to grow from $113 to $336 billion. Up to 55% of US Hispanics born in the year 2000 are expected to develop diabetes during their lifetime. Poor healthcare access and cultural barriers prevent optimal care, adherence, and clinical benefit, placing Hispanics at disproportionate risk for costly diabetes complications. Mobile technology is increasingly prevalent in all populations and can circumvent such barriers. Our group developed Dulce Digital, an educational text messaging program that improved glycemic control relative to usual care. Dulce Digital-Me (DD-Me) has been tailored to a participant's individual needs with a greater focus on health behavior change.
This is a three-arm, parallel group, randomized trial with equal allocation ratio enrolling Hispanic adults with low income and poorly managed type 2 diabetes (N = 414) from a San Diego County Federally Qualified Health Center. Participants are randomized to receive Dulce Digital, Dulce Digital-Me-Automated, or Dulce Digital-Me-Telephonic. The DD-Me groups include Dulce Digital components plus personalized goal-setting and feedback delivered via algorithm-driven automated text messaging (DD-Me-Automated) or by the care team health coach (DD-Me-Telephonic) over a 12-month follow-up period. The study will examine the comparative effectiveness of the three groups in improving diabetes clinical control [HbA1c, primary outcome; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and systolic blood pressure (SBP)] and patient-provider communication and patient adherence (i.e., medication, self-management tasks) over 12 months and will examine cost-effectiveness of the three interventions.
Our comparative evaluation of three mHealth approaches will elucidate how technology can be integrated most effectively and efficiently within primary care-based chronic care model approaches to reduce diabetes disparities in Hispanics and will assess two modes of personalized messaging delivery (i.e., automated messaging vs. telephonic by health coach) to inform cost and acceptability.

34957864,Hangaard et al.,"The Effectiveness of Telemedicine Solutions for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes: A Systematic Review, Meta-Analysis, and Meta-Regression.","Previous systematic reviews have aimed to clarify the effect of telemedicine on diabetes. However, such reviews often have a narrow focus, which calls for a more comprehensive systematic review within the field. Hence, the objective of the present systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression is to evaluate the effectiveness of telemedicine solutions versus any comparator without the use of telemedicine on diabetes-related outcomes among adult patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
This review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We considered telemedicine randomized controlled trials (RCT) including adults (≥18 years) diagnosed with T2D. Change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c, %) was the primary outcome. PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched on October 14, 2020. An overall treatment effect was estimated using a meta-analysis performed on the pool of included studies based on the mean difference (MD). The revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was applied and the certainty of evidence was graded using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach.
The final sample of papers included a total of 246, of which 168 had sufficient information to calculate the effect of HbA1c%. The results favored telemedicine, with an MD of -0.415% (95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.482% to -0.348%). The heterogeneity was great (I
In conclusion, telemedicine may serve as a valuable supplement to usual care for patients with T2D. The inclusion of a telemonitoring component seems to increase the effect of telemedicine.","['Denmark', 'diabetes mellitus', 'meta-analysis', 'meta-regression', 'systematic review', 'telemedicine', 'type 2']",Journal of diabetes science and technology,"10.1177/19322968211064633

34831925,"Robson, Hosseinzadeh",Impact of Telehealth Care among Adults Living with Type 2 Diabetes in Primary Care: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomised Controlled Trials.,"Primary health care physicians are increasingly offering telehealth services to patients not only for its cost and time saving advantages but for the additional benefits telehealth can provide for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) such as improved self-management behaviours. To support the development of telehealth based T2D clinical care models in primary health care settings, a narrative synthesis and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trial studies was completed for 29 studies that evaluated the effect of one or more types of telehealth interventions on HbA1c levels compared to usual care alone. Results from the random effects meta-analysis demonstrated that telehealth interventions had a stronger influence on HbA1c compared to usual care with a mean difference in HbA1c \% -0.18 (CI -0.35, -0.01), ","['diabetes mellitus', 'telecare', 'telehealth', 'telemedicine', 'type 2 diabetes']",International journal of environmental research and public health,"10.3390/ijerph182212171

34547030,Jia et al.,Evaluation of an mHealth-enabled hierarchical diabetes management intervention in primary care in China (ROADMAP): A cluster randomized trial.,"Glycemic control remains suboptimal in developing countries due to critical system deficiencies. An innovative mobile health (mHealth)-enabled hierarchical diabetes management intervention was introduced and evaluated in China with the purpose of achieving better control of type 2 diabetes in primary care.
A community-based cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted among registered patients with type 2 diabetes in primary care from June 2017 to July 2019. A total of 19,601 participants were recruited from 864 communities (clusters) across 25 provinces in China, and 19,546 completed baseline assessment. Moreover, 576 communities (13,037 participants) were centrally randomized to the intervention and 288 communities (6,509 participants) to usual care. The intervention was centered on a tiered care team-delivered mHealth-mediated service package, initiated by monthly blood glucose monitoring at each structured clinic visit. Capacity building and quarterly performance review strategies upheld the quality of delivered primary care. The primary outcome was control of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c; <7.0%), assessed at baseline and 12 months. The secondary outcomes include the individual/combined control rates of blood glucose, blood pressure (BP), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C); changes in levels of HbA1c, BP, LDL-C, fasting blood glucose (FBG), and body weight; and episodes of hypoglycemia. Data were analyzed using intention-to-treat (ITT) generalized estimating equation (GEE) models, accounting for clustering and baseline values of the analyzed outcomes. After 1-year follow-up, 17,554 participants (89.8%) completed the end-of-study (EOS) assessment, with 45.1% of them from economically developed areas, 49.9% from urban areas, 60.5 (standard deviation [SD] 8.4) years of age, 41.2% male, 6.0 years of median diabetes duration, HbA1c level of 7.87% (SD 1.92%), and 37.3% with HbA1c <7.0% at baseline. Compared with usual care, the intervention led to an absolute improvement in the HbA1c control rate of 7.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.0% to 10.0%) and a relative improvement of 18.6% (relative risk [RR] 1.186, 95% CI 1.105 to 1.267) and an absolute improvement in the composite ABC control (HbA1c <7.0%, BP <140/80 mm Hg, and LDL-C <2.6 mmol/L) rate of 1.9% (95% CI 0.5 to 3.5) and a relative improvement of 21.8% (RR 1.218, 95% CI 1.062 to 1.395). No difference was found on hypoglycemia episode and weight gain between groups. Study limitations include noncentralized laboratory tests except for HbA1c, and caution should be exercised when extrapolating the findings to patients not registered in primary care system.
The mHealth-enabled hierarchical diabetes management intervention effectively improved diabetes control in primary care and has the potential to be transferred to other chronic conditions management in similar contexts.

34385148,Vaughan et al.,Mentored implementation to initiate a diabetes program in an underserved community: a pilot study.,"Community clinics often face pragmatic barriers, hindering program initiation and replication of controlled research trial results. Mentoring is a potential strategy to overcome these barriers. We piloted an in-person and telehealth mentoring strategy to implement the 
Participants (n=55) were low-income Latino(a)s with type 2 diabetes. The study occurred in two, 6-month phases. Phase I provided proof-of-concept and an observational experience for the clinic team; participants (n=37) were randomized to the intervention (TIME) or control (usual care), and the research team conducted TIME while the clinic team observed. Phase II provided mentorship to implement TIME, and the research team mentored the clinic team as they conducted TIME for a new single-arm cohort of participants (n=18) with no previous exposure to the program. Analyses included baseline to 6-month comparisons of diabetes outcomes (primary outcome: hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)): phase I intervention versus control, phase II (within group), and research-run (phase I intervention) versus clinic-run (phase II) arms. We also evaluated baseline to 6-month CHW knowledge changes.
Phase I: compared with the control, intervention participants had superior baseline to 6-month improvements for HbA1c (mean change: intervention: -0.73% vs control: 0.08%, p=0.016), weight (p=0.044), target HbA1c (p=0.035), hypoglycemia (p=0.021), medication non-adherence (p=0.0003), and five of six American Diabetes Association (ADA) measures (p<0.001-0.002). Phase II: participants had significant reductions in HbA1c (mean change: -0.78%, p=0.006), diastolic blood pressure (p=0.004), body mass index (0.012), weight (p=0.010), medication non-adherence (p<0.001), and six ADA measures (p=0.007-0.005). Phase I intervention versus phase II outcomes were comparable. CHWs improved knowledge from pre-test to post-tests (p<0.001).
A novel, mentored approach to implement TIME into a community clinic resulted in improved diabetes outcomes. Larger studies of longer duration are needed to fully evaluate the potential of mentoring community clinics.","['community medicine', 'health services research', 'medication adherence', 'telemedicine']",BMJ open diabetes research & care,"10.1136/bmjdrc-2021-002320

34314856,Rising et al.,Assessing the impact of medically tailored meals and medical nutrition therapy on type 2 diabetes: Protocol for Project MiNT.,"Research has shown that among people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, reduction in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) prevents long term complications. Medically tailored meals (MTM) and telehealth-delivered medical nutrition therapy (tele-MNT) are promising strategies for patient-centered diabetes care.
Project MiNT will determine whether provision of MTM with and without the addition of telehealth-delivered medical nutrition therapy improves HbA1c and is cost effective for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (HbA1c >8%) will be recruited from Jefferson Health. Eligible patients will be randomized to one of three arms: 1) usual care, 2) 12 weeks of home-delivered MTM, or 3) MTM + 12 months of tele-MNT. All participants (n = 600) will complete three follow-up assessments at 3, 6, and 12 months. The primary outcome is change in HbA1c at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include change in HbA1c at 3 and 12 months and cost-effectiveness of the intervention at 6 and 12 months. Conclusion Findings from Project MiNT will inform MTM coverage and financing decisions, how to structure services for scalability and system-wide integration, and the role of these services in reducing health disparities.","['Diabetes mellitus', 'Hemoglobin A1c', 'Medical nutrition therapy', 'Medically tailored meals', 'Telehealth']",Contemporary clinical trials,"10.1016/j.cct.2021.106511

34251865,Egede et al.,Randomized controlled trial of technology-assisted case management in low-income adults with type 2 diabetes: Effect on quality of life and blood pressure.,"A novel randomized controlled trial tested the efficacy of a technology-assisted case management program in a low income, rural population previously where nurses titrated medication over the phone instead of in a clinic. The primary analysis showed significant improvement in glycemic control at 6 months post-randomization decreasing hemoglobin A1c by 1%. This study aimed to test if the intervention was also effective at decreasing blood pressure without compromising quality of life.
A total of 113 adults with poorly controlled diabetes (hemoglobin A1c ≥ 8%) were randomly assigned to the technology-assisted case management intervention or usual care. Participants received a 2-in-1 telehealth system to monitor glycemic and blood pressure control, which was uploaded daily to a central server. A nurse case manager was trained to titrate medication under physician supervision every 2 weeks based on the readings. Outcomes were blood pressure and quality of life (12-item Short-Form Health Survey) at 6 months. Baseline adjusted mixed models using a random intercept were used to evaluate change at 6 months for the technology-assisted case management intervention group compared to usual care.
There were no statistically significant differences in systolic blood pressure, physical component of quality of life, or mental component of quality of life between the technology-assisted case management and control group. However, there was a significant change in diastolic blood pressure over time, with the technology-assisted case management group decreasing at 6 months (
Technology-assisted case management by a nurse with medication titration under physician supervision was efficacious in improving diastolic blood pressure without compromising quality of life in low-income rural adults with diabetes.","['Diabetes', 'medication', 'nurse', 'quality of life', 'randomized control trial', 'remote monitoring', 'rural', 'technology', 'telehealth', 'titration']",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,10.1177/1357633X211028491,2021-07-13,"[{'lastname': 'Egede', 'firstname': 'Leonard E', 'initials': 'LE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Division of General Internal Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, USA.\nCenter for Advancing Population Science, Medical College of Wisconsin, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Dawson', 'firstname': 'Aprill Z', 'initials': 'AZ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Division of General Internal Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, USA.\nCenter for Advancing Population Science, Medical College of Wisconsin, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Walker', 'firstname': 'Rebekah J', 'initials': 'RJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Division of General Internal Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, USA.\nCenter for Advancing Population Science, Medical College of Wisconsin, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Garraci', 'firstname': 'Emma', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Division of General Internal Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, USA.\nCenter for Advancing Population Science, Medical College of Wisconsin, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Knapp', 'firstname': 'Rebecca G', 'initials': 'RG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health Services, College of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, USA.'}]",34251865,ca2a5a8d-0233-448e-84a0-d6d23766892a,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""J Telemed Telecare"""
34139330,"El-Gayar, Ofori, Nawar",On the efficacy of behavior change techniques in mHealth for self-management of diabetes: A meta-analysis.,"Diabetes prevalence has become a global crisis. Due to the substantial rise in smartphone use, a variety of mobile interventions have been developed to help improve the clinical outcomes of diabetes patients.
This study seeks to examine specific behavior change theories and techniques used in the design of self-management mobile app-based interventions aimed at achieving glycemic control in type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
A meta-analysis of randomized control trials published in PubMed/Medline and Web of Science between January 2010 and October 2020 was conducted using studies that included diabetes patients, reported on well-described mobile app-based interventions, compared mHealth to usual care, and evaluated glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at baseline and follow-up.
We reported on 21 studies with a total of 1,920 diabetes patients. Our findings show that mHealth apps led to statistically significant clinical outcomes as compared to standard care for glycemic control (-0.38, 95% CI = -0.50 to -0.25, p < 0.0001) indicating that such interventions result in a reduction in HbA1c. Interventions that used behavior theory for developing mHealth apps were not statistically different from those that did not (p = 0.18). However, increased use of behavior change techniques (BCTs) may result in slightly higher HbA1c reduction. Among all BCTs, the most effective ones appear to be ""Action planning"" and ""Self-monitoring of outcome(s) of behavior.
The current meta-analysis provides evidence that mHealth is likely to be beneficial for diabetes patients when the right behavior change techniques are applied to realize the full advantage of the intervention. Further investigation of the role of theory in the design of mHealth app-based interventions is warranted.","['Behavior change techniques', 'Behavior change theory', 'Diabetes mellitus', 'Mobile applications', 'Smartphones', 'mHealth']",Journal of biomedical informatics,10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103839,2021-06-18,"[{'lastname': 'El-Gayar', 'firstname': 'Omar', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Dakota State University, United States.

33587045,"Eberle, Löhnert, Stichling",Effectiveness of Disease-Specific mHealth Apps in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus: Scoping Review.,"According to the World Health Organization, the worldwide prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is increasing dramatically and DM comprises a large part of the global burden of disease. At the same time, the ongoing digitalization that is occurring in society today offers novel possibilities to deal with this challenge, such as the creation of mobile health (mHealth) apps. However, while a great variety of DM-specific mHealth apps exist, the evidence in terms of their clinical effectiveness is still limited.
The objective of this review was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of mHealth apps in DM management by analyzing health-related outcomes in patients diagnosed with type 1 DM (T1DM), type 2 DM (T2DM), and gestational DM.
A scoping review was performed. A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Web of Science Core Collection databases for studies published between January 2008 and October 2020. The studies were categorized by outcomes and type of DM. In addition, we carried out a meta-analysis to determine the impact of DM-specific mHealth apps on the management of glycated hemoglobin (HbA

33525952,M Tourkmani et al.,The impact of telemedicine on patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia: Findings and implications.,"Routine diabetes care changed during the COVID-19 pandemic due to precautionary measures such as lockdowns, cancellation of in-person visits, and patients' fear of being infected when attending clinics. Because of the pandemic, virtual clinics were implemented to provide diabetes care. Therefore, we conducted this study to assess the impact of these virtual clinics on glycaemic control among high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM).
A prospective single-cohort pre-/post telemedicine care intervention study was conducted on 130 patients with type 2 DM attending a virtual integrated care clinic at a chronic Illness center in a family and community medicine department in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The mean age of the participants was 57 years (standard deviation (SD) = 12) and the mean (SD) duration of diabetes was 14 (7) years. Over a period of 4 months, the HbA1c decreased significantly from 9.98 ± 1.33 pre-intervention to 8.32 ± 1.31 post-intervention (mean difference 1.66 ± 1.29; CI = 1.43-1.88; 
The current study found a significant positive impact of telemedicine care on glycaemic control among high-risk patients with DM during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, it showed that telemedicine could be integrated into diabetic care to successfully replace many of the usual in-person care visits. Consequently, health policy makers need to consider developing comprehensive guidelines in Saudi Arabia for telemedicine care to, ensure the quality of care and address issues such as financial reimbursement and patient information privacy.","['COVID-19', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Telemedicine', 'uncontrolled diabetes mellitus']",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,10.1177/1357633X20985763,2021-02-03,"[{'lastname': 'M Tourkmani', 'firstname': 'Ayla', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Chronic Illness Center, Family and Community Medicine Department, Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'J ALHarbi', 'firstname': 'Turki', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Chronic Illness Center, Family and Community Medicine Department, Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'Rsheed', 'firstname': 'Abdulaziz M Bin', 'initials': 'AMB', 'affiliation': 'Chronic Illness Center, Family and Community Medicine Department, Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'Alrasheedy', 'firstname': 'Alian A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacy Practice, College of Pharmacy, Qassim University, Buraidah, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'ALMadani', 'firstname': 'Wedad', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'National Center for Evidence based Health Practice, Saudi Health Council, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'ALJuraisi', 'firstname': 'Fahad', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Armed Forces Medical Services Directorate, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'AlOtaibi', 'firstname': 'Azzam Fahad', 'initials': 'AF', 'affiliation': 'Chronic Illness Center, Family and Community Medicine Department, Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'AlHarbi', 'firstname': 'Mohammed', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Family and community Medicine, College of Medicine, Majmaah University, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'AlAbood', 'firstname': 'Abood F', 'initials': 'AF', 'affiliation': 'Armed Forces Medical Services Directorate, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'Alshaikh', 'firstname': 'Abdulaziz A Ibn', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'Armed Forces Medical Services Directorate, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.'}]","33525952

32927269,Randall et al.,The effect of remote patient monitoring on the primary care clinic visit frequency among adults with type 2 diabetes.,"Healthcare organizations are increasingly using technology to assist in diabetes management based on telemedicine's proven ability to improve glycemic regulation, decrease cost, and overcome barriers to effective healthcare. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how telemedicine intersects with primary care. We aim to measure the impact of a remote monitoring program for diabetes on primary care delivery through analysis of primary care office visit frequency.
Patients eligible to participate in our institution's remote diabetes monitoring program were identified and classified as enrolled or not enrolled (i.e. ""usual care""). The number of scheduled and completed primary care office visits in the 12 months prior to and after the index date were measured for both groups. The index date was the enrollment date or, for the patients who received usual care, the next available enrollment session after eligibility screen. Two-sample t-tests were used to examine the change in frequency of office visits prior to and after enrollment for participants, as well as the difference in visit frequency between enrolled patients versus patients receiving usual care.
There was no statistical difference in the number of scheduled or completed primary care clinic visits before or after enrollment in telehealth. Furthermore, there was no difference in the number of scheduled or completed primary care visits between patients enrolled in telehealth versus those receiving usual care.
Participation in telehealth has been shown to be associated with significant HbA1c reductions in prior work, yet our data suggest that remote monitoring is not associated with a change in primary care office visit frequency. This suggests that telehealth may improve diabetes management independently of primary care visits.","['Diabetes', 'Primary care', 'Remote patient monitoring', 'Telehealth', 'Telemedicine']",International journal of medical informatics,"10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2020.104267

When implementing new programmes into standard care, considering patients' preferences may increase the success of the participants. This study aims to examine the preferences of people with T2DM with respect to telemedical lifestyle programmes, to analyse whether these preferences predict programme success and to explore the changes that may occur during a telemedical lifestyle intervention.
We outline the protocol of the development and assessment of a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to examine patient preferences in a telemedical lifestyle programme with regard to the functions of the online portal, communication, responsibilities, group activities and time requirements. To develop the design of the DCE, we conducted pilot work involving healthcare experts and in particular people with T2DM using cognitive pretesting.

32700217,Vaughan et al.,"A Telehealth-supported, Integrated care with CHWs, and MEdication-access (TIME) Program for Diabetes Improves HbA1c: a Randomized Clinical Trial.","Many individuals with diabetes live in low- or middle-income settings. Glycemic control is challenging, particularly in resource-limited areas that face numerous healthcare barriers.
To compare HbA1c outcomes for individuals randomized to TIME, a Telehealth-supported, Integrated care with CHWs (Community Health Workers), and MEdication-access program (intervention) versus usual care (wait-list control).
Randomized clinical trial.
Low-income Latino(a) adults with type 2 diabetes.
TIME consisted of (1) CHW-participant telehealth communication via mobile health (mHealth) for 12 months, (2) CHW-led monthly group visits for 6 months, and (3) weekly CHW-physician diabetes training and support via telehealth (video conferencing).
Investigators compared TIME versus control participant baseline to month 6 changes of HbA1c (primary outcome), blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), weight, and adherence to seven American Diabetes Association (ADA) standards of care. CHW assistance in identifying barriers to healthcare in the intervention group were measured at the end of mHealth communication (12 months).
A total of 89 individuals participated. TIME individuals compared to control participants had significant HbA1c decreases (9.02 to 7.59% (- 1.43%) vs. 8.71 to 8.26% (- 0.45%), respectively, p = 0.002), blood pressure changes (systolic: - 6.89 mmHg vs. 0.03 mmHg, p = 0.023; diastolic: - 3.36 mmHg vs. 0.2 mmHg, respectively, p = 0.046), and ADA guideline adherence (p < 0.001) from baseline to month 6. At month 6, more TIME than control participants achieved > 0.50% HbA1c reductions (88.57% vs. 43.75%, p < 0.001). BMI and weight changes were not significant between groups. Many (54.6%) TIME participants experienced > 1 barrier to care, of whom 91.7% had medication issues. CHWs identified the majority (87.5%) of barriers.
TIME participants resulted in improved outcomes including HbA1c. CHWs are uniquely positioned to identify barriers to care particularly related to medications that may have gone unrecognized otherwise. Larger trials are needed to determine the scalability and sustainability of the intervention.

32459631,Toro-Ramos et al.,Mobile Delivery of the Diabetes Prevention Program in People With Prediabetes: Randomized Controlled Trial.,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) diabetes prevention program (DPP) has formed the foundation for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) prevention efforts and lifestyle change modifications in multiple care settings. To our knowledge, no randomized controlled trial has verified the efficacy of a fully mobile version of CDC's diabetes prevention program (DPP).
This study aimed to investigate the long-term weight loss and glycemic efficacy of a mobile-delivered DPP compared with a control group receiving usual medical care.
Adults with prediabetes (N=202) were recruited from a clinic and randomized to either a mobile-delivered, coach-guided DPP (Noom) or a control group that received regular medical care including a paper-based DPP curriculum and no formal intervention. The intervention group learned how to use the Noom program, how to interact with their coach, and the importance of maintaining motivation. They had access to an interactive coach-to-participant interface and group messaging, daily challenges for behavior change, DPP-based education articles, food logging, and automated feedback. Primary outcomes included changes in weight and hemoglobin A
A total of 202 participants were recruited and randomized into the intervention (n=101) or control group (n=99). In the intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses, changes in the participants' weight and BMI were significantly different at 6 months between the intervention and control groups, but there was no difference in HbA
This novel mobile-delivered DPP achieved significant weight loss reductions for up to 1 year compared with usual care. This type of intervention reduces the risk of overt diabetes without the added barriers of in-person interventions.

This secondary analysis included the full sample of 126 Hispanic adults (mean age = 48.43 years, SD = 9.80) with type 2 diabetes and glycosylated hemoglobin A1C >7.5% enrolled from a Federally Qualified Health Center in a randomized, nonblinded clinical trial that compared Dulce Digital to usual care. Dulce Digital participants received educational/motivational, medication reminders, and blood glucose monitoring prompt text messages over 6 months.
Baseline levels of DD prospectively moderated the effect of Dulce Digital (vs usual care) on glycemic control over 6 months, such that Dulce Digital participants with higher DD experienced relatively greater benefit from the intervention. The effect of the intervention on A1C change was 178% larger among individuals experiencing moderate/high versus no/low DD.
Although research has found DD to be associated with poorer self-management and clinical outcomes, individuals already distressed about their diabetes may benefit from a lower-burden mHealth DSME/S approach.",[],The Diabetes educator,10.1177/0145721720913276,2020-04-02,"[{'lastname': 'Clark', 'firstname': 'Taylor L', 'initials': 'TL', 'affiliation': 'San Diego Joint Doctoral Program in Clinical Psychology, San Diego State University/University of California, San Diego, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Gallo', 'firstname': 'Linda', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, San Diego State University, San Diego, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Euyoque', 'firstname': 'Johanna A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': 'Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute, Scripps Health, San Diego, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Philis-Tsimikas', 'firstname': 'Athena', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute, Scripps Health, San Diego, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Fortmann', 'firstname': 'Addie', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute, Scripps Health, San Diego, California.'}]","32228288

In this study, we will test the effectiveness of CareAvenue - an automated e-health tool that screens for unmet social risk factors and informs and activates individuals to take steps to connect to resources and engage in self-care. We will determine the effectiveness of CareAvenue relative to standard care with respect to improving glycemic control and patient-centered outcomes such as cost-related non-adherence (CRN) behaviors and perceived financial burden. We will also examine the role of patient risk factors (moderators) and behavioral factors (mediators) on the effectiveness of CareAvenue in improving outcomes. We will recruit 720 patients in a large health system with uncontrolled Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) or Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who engage in CRN or perceive financial burden.

We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a mobile health (mHealth) based and three-tiered diabetes management system in diverse Chinese contexts.
This is a cluster randomised controlled trial, named road to hierarchical diabetes management at primary care (ROADMAP). 19 008 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) were recruited from primary care clinics in 864 communities across 144 counties/districts of 24 provinces. Eligible participants were adult patients diagnosed with T2D and registered for diabetes management in communities. Patients within the same communities (clusters) were randomly allocated into the intervention or control arm for 1 year in a 2:1 ratio. The control arm patients received usual care as EPHS packaged: at least four blood glucose (BG) and blood pressure (BP) tests, and lifestyle and medication instruction, yearly, from primary care providers. The intervention arm patients received at least two BG and one BP tests, monthly, and lifestyle and treatment instruction from a three-tiered contracted team. A mHealth platform,

More than 2 million people in Kuwait own mobile phones. We will test whether automated personalised health text messages based on principles of motivational interviewing and are responsive to biodata delivered remotely is potentially effective in improving glycaemic control compared to usual care.
This is a two-arm parallel single-blind randomised controlled trial of 572 individuals with type 2 diabetes in Kuwait. We will develop a culturally appropriate database of text messages supporting positive lifestyle changes in type 2 diabetes. A computer programme will deliver over 400 text messages over a 12-month period using algorithms which provide participants with information on diet and physical activity as well as personalised messages regarding motivators to change behaviours. Individuals aged 18-75 years with established type 2 diabetes who are fluent in Arabic or English and officially resident in Kuwait will be identified via screening of hospital diabetes clinic and primary care practices and invited to participate. A sample of 572 participants will be randomised to usual care or usual care plus the DATES text message intervention. Randomisation will be conducted by an independent Clinical Trials Unit and researchers collecting baseline and outcome data will be blinded to treatment allocation. The primary outcome is change in HbA1c and weight at 12 months in both study arms. Secondary outcomes will include changes in physical activity, fasting lipids and quality of life in both study arms.
The potential of mobile phones in improving diabetes self-care in settings with a high prevalence of diabetes and widespread mobile phone usage has face validity. Mobile phones and text messaging are an understudied virtual communication media which can deliver discrete focused psychological support to motivate and enable diabetes self-care changes.

30346819,de Vasconcelos et al.,Telecoaching programme for type 2 diabetes control: a randomised clinical trial.,"People with diabetes have a high risk of developing micro and macrovascular complications that increase treatment costs and shorten life expectancy. Telecoaching programmes can improve short-term control of diabetes and reduce disease burden.
To analyse the effect of a health telecoaching programme in the control of type 2 diabetes.
A pragmatic clinical trial was carried out. Thirty-one patients with type 2 diabetes were divided into control and intervention groups. The control group received usual nursing care, and those in the intervention group received usual care and telecoaching for 24 weeks.
The intervention group improved: measurements of abdominal circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and body mass index; variables related to glycaemic control (fasting venous glucose and glycated haemoglobin/HbA1c); and high-density lipoprotein levels.
The data indicate that telecoaching is an effective tool for diabetes management. It is recommended that the study should be developed to include more people and run over the long term.","['Diabetes', 'Patient support', 'Telecoaching', 'Telehealth']",British journal of nursing (Mark Allen Publishing),10.12968/bjon.2018.27.19.1115,2018-10-23,"[{'lastname': 'de Vasconcelos', 'firstname': 'Hérica Cristina Alves', 'initials': 'HCA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nursing, Federal University of Ceará, Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Lira Neto', 'firstname': 'José Claudio Garcia', 'initials': 'JCG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nursing, Federal University of Ceará, Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'de Araújo', 'firstname': 'Márcio Flávio Moura', 'initials': 'MFM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nursing, University of International Integration of Afro-Brazilian Lusophony, Redenção, Ceará, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Carvalho', 'firstname': 'Gerdane Celene Nunes', 'initials': 'GCN', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nursing, Federal University of Ceará, Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'de Souza Teixeira', 'firstname': 'Carla Regina', 'initials': 'CR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nursing, University of São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'de Freitas', 'firstname': 'Roberto Wagner Júnior Freire', 'initials': 'RWJF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Family Health, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Damasceno', 'firstname': 'Marta Maria Coelho', 'initials': 'MMC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nursing, Federal University of Ceará, Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil.'}]",30346819,ca2a5a8d-0233-448e-84a0-d6d23766892a,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Br J Nurs"""

29940936,"Lee, Greenfield, Pappas",The impact of telehealth remote patient monitoring on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials.,"There is a growing body of evidence to support the use of telehealth in monitoring HbA1c levels in people living with type 2 diabetes. However, the overall magnitude of effect is yet unclear due to variable results reported in existing systematic reviews. The objective of this study is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials to create an evidence-base for the effectiveness of telehealth interventions on glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes.
Electronic databases including The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, HMIC, and PsychINFO were searched to identify relevant systematic reviews published between 1990 and April 2016, supplemented by references search from the relevant reviews. Two independent reviewers selected and reviewed the eligible studies. Of the 3279 references retrieved, 4 systematic reviews reporting in total 29 unique studies relevant to our review were included. Both conventional pairwise meta-analyses and network meta-analyses were performed.
Evidence from pooling four systematic reviews found that telehealth interventions produced a small but significant improvement in HbA1c levels compared with usual care (MD: -0.55, 95% CI: -0.73 to - 0.36). The greatest effect was seen in telephone-delivered interventions, followed by Internet blood glucose monitoring system interventions and lastly interventions involving automatic transmission of SMBG using a mobile phone or a telehealth unit.
Current evidence suggests that telehealth is effective in controlling HbA1c levels in people living with type 2 diabetes. However there is need for better quality primary studies as well as systematic reviews of RCTs in order to confidently conclude on the impact of telehealth on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes.","['Blood glucose', 'Remote', 'Telehealth', 'Type 2 diabetes mellitus']",BMC health services research,"10.1186/s12913-018-3274-8

29878825,Döbler et al.,Telephone-delivered lifestyle support with action planning and motivational interviewing techniques to improve rehabilitation outcomes.,"In this randomized controlled trial, we evaluated the effectiveness of a telephone-delivered intervention based on the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) after discharge from inpatient rehabilitation to address behavior change, emotional status, and glycemic control in patients with Type 2 diabetes.
In a German rehabilitation center, 249 patients with Type 2 diabetes were separated into randomized groups, either a 12-month telephone follow-up support group or the usual care group. The counselor identified personal target areas and intervention modules and developed with the patient an individualized action plan for the telephone support. To enhance motivational processes, they used motivational interviewing techniques. Counselors called patients monthly to support the implementation of the personal plans into the patients' daily routines and to screen for emotional problems. Assessments measured exercise, diet, medication adherence, psychological variables, body mass index, HbA1c, and cardiovascular risk.
Twelve months after inpatient rehabilitation, the telephone group's rate of physical activity rose by 26% compared with the usual care group's 10%. Patients in the intervention group exhibited greater improvements in terms of their illness burden, psychological well-being, and depression. HbA1c fell in the telephone group but increased in the usual care group (-0.68% vs. 0.12%). The intervention group's cardiovascular risk fell, whereas the usual care group's rose (-0.57 vs. 0.23).
A theory-based telephone-delivered follow-up intervention utilizing motivational interviewing techniques and focusing on personalized action planning demonstrated improvements in patients' level of activity and health status 12-months postrehabilitation discharge and may be a beneficial supplement to rehabilitation programs.

29555621,Levy et al.,Transition of a Text-Based Insulin Titration Program From a Randomized Controlled Trial Into Real-World Settings: Implementation Study.,"The Mobile Insulin Titration Intervention (MITI) program helps patients with type 2 diabetes find their correct basal insulin dose without in-person care. Requiring only basic cell phone technology (text messages and phone calls), MITI is highly accessible to patients receiving care in safety-net settings. MITI was shown in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to be efficacious at a New York City (NYC) safety-net clinic where patients often have challenges coming for in-person care. In 2016, MITI was implemented as usual care at Bellevue Hospital (the site of the original RCT) and at Gouverneur Health (a second NYC safety-net clinic) under 2 different staffing models.
This implementation study examined MITI's transition into real-world settings. To understand MITI's flexibility, generalizability, and acceptability among patients and providers, we evaluated whether MITI continued to produce positive outcomes in expanded underserved populations, outside of an RCT setting.
Patients enrolled in MITI received weekday text messages asking for their fasting blood glucose (FBG) values and a weekly titration call. The goal was for patients to reach their optimal insulin dose (OID), defined either as the dose of once-daily basal insulin required to achieve either an FBG of 80-130 mg/dL (4.4-7.2 mmol/L) or as the reaching of the maximum dose of 50 units. After 12 weeks, if OID was not reached, the patients were asked to return to the clinic for in-person care and titration. MITI program outcomes, clinical outcomes, process outcomes, and patient satisfaction were assessed.
MITI was successful at both sites, each with a different staffing model. Providers referred 170 patients to the program-129 of whom (75.9%, 129/170) were eligible. Of these, 113 (87.6%, 113/129) enrolled. Moreover, 84.1% (95/113) of patients reached their OID, and they did so in an average of 24 days. Clinical outcomes show that mean FBG levels fell from 209 mg/dL (11.6 mmol/L) to 141 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L), P<.001. HbA
This implementation study showed MITI to have continued success after transitioning from an RCT program into real-world settings. MITI showed itself to be flexible and generalizable as it easily fits into a second site staffed by general medical clinic-registered nurses and remained acceptable to patients and staff who had high levels of engagement with the program.","['diabetes mellitus, type 2/drug therapy', 'healthcare disparities', 'insulin/long-acting/administration & dosage', 'medically underserved area', 'telemedicine']",Journal of medical Internet research,"10.2196/jmir.9515

29506562,Sarfati et al.,BetaMe: impact of a comprehensive digital health programme on HbA1c and weight at 12 months for people with diabetes and pre-diabetes: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.,"Long-term conditions (LTCs) are the biggest contributor to health loss in New Zealand. The economic cost and burden on the health system is substantial and growing. Self-management strategies offer a potential way to reduce the pressure on health services. This study evaluates a comprehensive self-management programme (the BetaMe programme) delivered by mobile and web-based technologies for people with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and pre-diabetes. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the BetaMe programme versus usual care among primary care populations in improving the control of T2DM and pre-diabetes, as measured by change in HbA1c and weight over 12 months.
Participants will be recruited through two primary healthcare organisations and a Māori healthcare provider in New Zealand (n = 430). Eligible participants will be 18 to 75 years old, with T2DM or pre-diabetes, with an HbA1c of 41-70 mmol/mol up to 2 years prior to study commencement. Eligible participants who consent to participate will be individually randomised to the control arm (usual care) or intervention arm (usual care and BetaMe). The programme consists of a 16-week core followed by a maintenance period of 36 weeks. It incorporates (1) individualised health coaching, (2) goal setting and tracking, (3) peer support in an online forum and (4) educational resources and behaviour-change tools. The primary outcome measures are change in HbA1c and weight at 12 months. Secondary outcomes are changes in waist circumference, blood pressure, patient activation and diabetes-specific behaviours. All outcomes will be assessed at 4 and 12 months for the total study population and for Māori and Pacific participants specifically. All primary analyses will be based on intention-to-treat. Primary analysis will use linear mixed models comparing mean outcome levels adjusted for initial baseline characteristics at 12 months.
This is a randomised controlled trial of a comprehensive self-management intervention for people with diabetes and pre-diabetes. If effective, this programme would allow healthcare providers to deliver an intervention that is person-centred and supports the self-care of people with T2DM, pre-diabetes and potentially other LTCs.

28978949,Lee et al.,Comparative effectiveness of telemedicine strategies on type 2 diabetes management: A systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"The effects of telemedicine strategies on the management of diabetes is not clear. This study aimed to investigate the impact of different telemedicine strategies on glycaemic control management of type 2 diabetes patients. A search was performed in 6 databases from inception until September 2016 for randomized controlled studies that examined the use of telemedicine in adults with type 2 diabetes. Studies were independently extracted and classified according to the following telemedicine strategies: teleeducation, telemonitoring, telecase-management, telementoring and teleconsultation. Traditional and network meta-analysis were performed to estimate the relative treatment effects. A total of 107 studies involving 20,501 participants were included. Over a median of 6 months follow-up, telemedicine reduced haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) by a mean of 0.43% (95% CI: -0.64% to -0.21%). Network meta-analysis showed that all telemedicine strategies were effective in reducing HbA1c significantly compared to usual care except for telecase-management and telementoring, with mean difference ranging from 0.37% and 0.71%. Ranking indicated that teleconsultation was the most effective telemedicine strategy, followed by telecase-management plus telemonitoring, and finally teleeducation plus telecase-management. The review indicates that most telemedicine strategies can be useful, either as an adjunct or to replace usual care, leading to clinically meaningful reduction in HbA1c.",[],Scientific reports,"10.1038/s41598-017-12987-z

28814128,Warren et al.,Effects of telemonitoring on glycaemic control and healthcare costs in type 2 diabetes: A randomised controlled trial.,"Introduction This study examined the effect of a telehealth intervention on the control of type 2 diabetes and subsequent potential cost-savings to the health system. Methods This prospective randomised controlled trial randomised adults with type 2 diabetes to the intervention (diabetes program) or control (usual care) arm. Key eligibility criteria included an HbA1c level of at least 58 mmol/mol (7.5%) without severe or unstable comorbidities. All participants continued their usual healthcare, but participants in the intervention arm received additional diabetes care from a diabetes care coordinator via a home monitor that captured clinical measures. Data collected included biomedical, quality of life measures and healthcare (GP, outpatient and inpatient) costs. The primary outcome was HbA1c collected at baseline and 6 months. Analysis was conducted on a complete case intention-to-treat basis. The healthcare system perspective was taken to calculate the incremental cost per percentage-point reduction in HbA1c. Results Results from 63 participants from each study arm were analysed. HbA1c in the intervention group decreased from a median 68 mmol/mol (8.4%) to 58 mmol/mol (7.5%), and remained unchanged in the control group at median 65 mmol/mol (8.1%) at the 6-month endpoint. The intervention effect on HbA1c change was statistically significant ( p = .004). Total healthcare costs in the intervention group, including the intervention costs, were lower (mean $3781 vs. $4662; p < .001) compared with usual care. Discussion There was a clinically meaningful and statistically significant benefit from the telehealth intervention at a lower cost; thus, telehealth was cost-saving and produced greater health benefits compared with usual care.","['HbA1c', 'Type 2 diabetes', 'glycaemic control', 'healthcare costs', 'telemedicine']",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,10.1177/1357633X17723943,2017-08-18,"[{'lastname': 'Warren', 'firstname': 'Robin', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': '1 The College of Medicine and Dentistry, James Cook University, Queensland, Australia; and formerly of Northern Australia Primary Health Ltd, Queensland, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Carlisle', 'firstname': 'Karen', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': '1 The College of Medicine and Dentistry, James Cook University, Queensland, Australia; and formerly of Northern Australia Primary Health Ltd, Queensland, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Mihala', 'firstname': 'Gabor', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': '2 Centre for Applied Health Economics, School of Medicine, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Queensland, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Scuffham', 'firstname': 'Paul A', 'initials': 'PA', 'affiliation': '2 Centre for Applied Health Economics, School of Medicine, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Queensland, Australia.'}]",28814128,ca2a5a8d-0233-448e-84a0-d6d23766892a,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""J Telemed Telecare"""
28698169,Frias et al.,"Effectiveness of Digital Medicines to Improve Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Uncontrolled Hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes: Prospective, Open-Label, Cluster-Randomized Pilot Clinical Trial.","Hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus are major modifiable risk factors for cardiac, cerebrovascular, and kidney diseases. Reasons for poor disease control include nonadherence, lack of patient engagement, and therapeutic inertia.
The aim of this study was to assess the impact on clinic-measured blood pressure (BP) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) using a digital medicine offering (DMO) that measures medication ingestion adherence, physical activity, and rest using digital medicines (medication taken with ingestible sensor), wearable sensor patches, and a mobile device app.
Participants with elevated systolic BP (SBP ≥140 mm Hg) and HbA1c (≥7%) failing antihypertensive (≥2 medications) and oral diabetes therapy were enrolled in this three-arm, 12-week, cluster-randomized study. Participants used DMO (includes digital medicines, the wearable sensor patch, and the mobile device app) for 4 or 12 weeks or received usual care based on site randomization. Providers in the DMO arms could review the DMO data via a Web portal. In all three arms, providers were instructed to make medical decisions (medication titration, adherence counseling, education, and lifestyle coaching) on all available clinical information at each visit. Primary outcome was change in SBP at week 4. Other outcomes included change in SBP and HbA1c at week 12, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at weeks 4 and 12, as well as proportion of patients at BP goal (<140/90 mm Hg) at weeks 4 and 12, medical decisions, and medication adherence patterns.
Final analysis included 109 participants (12 sites; age: mean 58.7, SD years; female: 49.5%, 54/109; Hispanic: 45.9%, 50/109; income ≤ US $20,000: 56.9%, 62/109; and ≤ high school education: 52.3%, 57/109). The DMO groups had 80 participants (7 sites) and usual care had 29 participants (5 sites). At week 4, DMO resulted in a statistically greater SBP reduction than usual care (mean -21.8, SE 1.5 mm Hg vs mean -12.7, SE 2.8 mmHg; mean difference -9.1, 95% CI -14.0 to -3.3 mm Hg) and maintained a greater reduction at week 12. The DMO groups had greater reductions in HbA1c, DBP, and LDL-C, and a greater proportion of participants at BP goal at weeks 4 and 12 compared with usual care. The DMO groups also received more therapeutic interventions than usual care. Medication adherence was ≥80% while using the DMO. The most common adverse event was a self-limited rash at the wearable sensor site (12%, 10/82).
For patients failing hypertension and diabetes oral therapy, this DMO, which provides dose-by-dose feedback on medication ingestion adherence, can help lower BP, HbA1c, and LDL-C, and promote patient engagement and provider decision making.

28602020,Moy et al.,Techniques of monitoring blood glucose during pregnancy for women with pre-existing diabetes.,"Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is recommended as a key component of the management plan for diabetes therapy during pregnancy. No existing systematic reviews consider the benefits/effectiveness of various techniques of blood glucose monitoring on maternal and infant outcomes among pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes. The effectiveness of the various monitoring techniques is unclear.
To compare techniques of blood glucose monitoring and their impact on maternal and infant outcomes among pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes.
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 November 2016), searched reference lists of retrieved studies and contacted trial authors.
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing techniques of blood glucose monitoring including SMBG, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) or clinic monitoring among pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2). Trials investigating timing and frequency of monitoring were also included. RCTs using a cluster-randomised design were eligible for inclusion but none were identified.
Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Data were checked for accuracy. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.
This review update includes at total of 10 trials (538) women (468 women with type 1 diabetes and 70 women with type 2 diabetes). The trials took place in Europe and the USA. Five of the 10 included studies were at moderate risk of bias, four studies were at low to moderate risk of bias, and one study was at high risk of bias. The trials are too small to show differences in important outcomes such as macrosomia, preterm birth, miscarriage or death of baby. Almost all the reported GRADE outcomes were assessed as being very low-quality evidence. This was due to design limitations in the studies, wide confidence intervals, small sample sizes, and few events. In addition, there was high heterogeneity for some outcomes.Various methods of glucose monitoring were compared in the trials. Neither pooled analyses nor individual trial analyses showed any clear advantages of one monitoring technique over another for primary and secondary outcomes. Many important outcomes were not reported.1. Self-monitoring versus standard care (two studies, 43 women): there was no clear difference for caesarean section (risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 1.49; one study, 28 women) or glycaemic control (both very low-quality), and not enough evidence to assess perinatal mortality and neonatal mortality and morbidity composite. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, large-for-gestational age, neurosensory disability, and preterm birth were not reported in either study.2. Self-monitoring versus hospitalisation (one study, 100 women): there was no clear difference for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (pre-eclampsia and hypertension) (RR 4.26, 95% CI 0.52 to 35.16; very low-quality: RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.22; very low-quality). There was no clear difference in caesarean section or preterm birth less than 37 weeks' gestation (both very low quality), and the sample size was too small to assess perinatal mortality (very low-quality). Large-for-gestational age, mortality or morbidity composite, neurosensory disability and preterm birth less than 34 weeks were not reported.3. Pre-prandial versus post-prandial glucose monitoring (one study, 61 women): there was no clear difference between groups for caesarean section (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.28; very low-quality), large-for-gestational age (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.85; very low-quality) or glycaemic control (very low-quality). The results for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: pre-eclampsia and perinatal mortality are not meaningful because these outcomes were too rare to show differences in a small sample (all very low-quality). The study did not report the outcomes mortality or morbidity composite, neurosensory disability or preterm birth.4. Automated telemedicine monitoring versus conventional system (three studies, 84 women): there was no clear difference for caesarean section (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.48; one study, 32 women; very low-quality), and mortality or morbidity composite in the one study that reported these outcomes. There were no clear differences for glycaemic control (very low-quality). No studies reported hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, large-for-gestational age, perinatal mortality (stillbirth and neonatal mortality), neurosensory disability or preterm birth.5.CGM versus intermittent monitoring (two studies, 225 women): there was no clear difference for pre-eclampsia (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.52 to 3.59; low-quality), caesarean section (average RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.54; I² = 62%; very low-quality) and large-for-gestational age (average RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.92; I² = 82%; very low-quality). Glycaemic control indicated by mean maternal HbA1c was lower for women in the continuous monitoring group (mean difference (MD) -0.60 %, 95% CI -0.91 to -0.29; one study, 71 women; moderate-quality). There was not enough evidence to assess perinatal mortality and there were no clear differences for preterm birth less than 37 weeks' gestation (low-quality). Mortality or morbidity composite, neurosensory disability and preterm birth less than 34 weeks were not reported.6. Constant CGM versus intermittent CGM (one study, 25 women): there was no clear difference between groups for caesarean section (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.79; very low-quality), glycaemic control (mean blood glucose in the 3rd trimester) (MD -0.14 mmol/L, 95% CI -2.00 to 1.72; very low-quality) or preterm birth less than 37 weeks' gestation (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.08 to 15.46; very low-quality). Other primary (hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, large-for-gestational age, perinatal mortality (stillbirth and neonatal mortality), mortality or morbidity composite, and neurosensory disability) or GRADE outcomes (preterm birth less than 34 weeks' gestation) were not reported.
This review found no evidence that any glucose monitoring technique is superior to any other technique among pregnant women with pre-existing type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The evidence base for the effectiveness of monitoring techniques is weak and additional evidence from large well-designed randomised trials is required to inform choices of glucose monitoring techniques.",[],The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"10.1002/14651858.CD009613.pub3

28581821,Egede et al.,Randomized Controlled Trial of Technology-Assisted Case Management in Low Income Adults with Type 2 Diabetes.,"To assess the efficacy of technology-assisted case management (TACM) with medication titration by nurses using guideline-based algorithms, under physician supervision in improving glycemic control in low-income rural adults with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes.
Adults (aged ≥18 years) from the southeastern United States with hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] ≥8% were randomized to TACM or usual care. Evidence-based guidelines were used to develop medication titration algorithms in conjunction with clinic physicians. Participants were given a telehealth device that uploaded blood glucose and blood pressure readings daily to a central server. A nurse case manager was trained on the algorithms and authorized to titrate medications every 2 weeks based on the algorithm under the supervision of an internist and an endocrinologist. Participants were assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. The primary outcome was HbA1c at 6-months postrandomization in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population.
One hundred thirteen participants were randomized to either TACM intervention or usual care. Based on ITT population after multiple imputation, the analysis of covariance with baseline HbA1c as covariate showed that HbA1c at 6 months for TACM was significantly lower compared to the usual care group (-0. 99, P = 0.024). Moreover, longitudinal mixed effects analysis suggested that the rate of decline in HbA1c over time for TACM was significantly faster compared to the usual care group (-0.16, P = 0.038). Results based on per-protocol population were similar.
Technology-assisted case management by a nurse with medication titration under physician supervision is efficacious in improving glycemic control in low-income rural adults with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes.","['Case management', 'Diabetes technology', 'Telemedicine']",Diabetes technology & therapeutics,10.1089/dia.2017.0006,2017-06-06,"[{'lastname': 'Egede', 'firstname': 'Leonard E', 'initials': 'LE', 'affiliation': '1 Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin , Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n2 Center for Patient Care and Outcomes Research (PCOR), Medical College of Wisconsin , Milwaukee, Wisconsin.'}, {'lastname': 'Williams', 'firstname': 'Joni S', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': '1 Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin , Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n2 Center for Patient Care and Outcomes Research (PCOR), Medical College of Wisconsin , Milwaukee, Wisconsin.'}, {'lastname': 'Voronca', 'firstname': 'Delia C', 'initials': 'DC', 'affiliation': '3 Emmes, Vaccine and Infectious Diseases, Rockville, Maryland.'}, {'lastname': 'Knapp', 'firstname': 'Rebecca G', 'initials': 'RG', 'affiliation': '4 Department of Public Health Sciences, Medical University of South Carolina , Charleston, South Carolina.'}, {'lastname': 'Fernandes', 'firstname': 'Jyotika K', 'initials': 'JK', 'affiliation': '5 Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Medical Genetics, Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina , Charleston, South Carolina.'}]",28581821,ca2a5a8d-0233-448e-84a0-d6d23766892a,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Diabetes Technol Ther"""
28526671,Hanlon et al.,"Telehealth Interventions to Support Self-Management of Long-Term Conditions: A Systematic Metareview of Diabetes, Heart Failure, Asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, and Cancer.","Self-management support is one mechanism by which telehealth interventions have been proposed to facilitate management of long-term conditions.
The objectives of this metareview were to (1) assess the impact of telehealth interventions to support self-management on disease control and health care utilization, and (2) identify components of telehealth support and their impact on disease control and the process of self-management. Our goal was to synthesise evidence for telehealth-supported self-management of diabetes (types 1 and 2), heart failure, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cancer to identify components of effective self-management support.
We performed a metareview (a systematic review of systematic reviews) of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of telehealth interventions to support self-management in 6 exemplar long-term conditions. We searched 7 databases for reviews published from January 2000 to May 2016 and screened identified studies against eligibility criteria. We weighted reviews by quality (revised A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews), size, and relevance. We then combined our results in a narrative synthesis and using harvest plots.
We included 53 systematic reviews, comprising 232 unique RCTs. Reviews concerned diabetes (type 1: n=6; type 2, n=11; mixed, n=19), heart failure (n=9), asthma (n=8), COPD (n=8), and cancer (n=3). Findings varied between and within disease areas. The highest-weighted reviews showed that blood glucose telemonitoring with feedback and some educational and lifestyle interventions improved glycemic control in type 2, but not type 1, diabetes, and that telemonitoring and telephone interventions reduced mortality and hospital admissions in heart failure, but these findings were not consistent in all reviews. Results for the other conditions were mixed, although no reviews showed evidence of harm. Analysis of the mediating role of self-management, and of components of successful interventions, was limited and inconclusive. More intensive and multifaceted interventions were associated with greater improvements in diabetes, heart failure, and asthma.
While telehealth-mediated self-management was not consistently superior to usual care, none of the reviews reported any negative effects, suggesting that telehealth is a safe option for delivery of self-management support, particularly in conditions such as heart failure and type 2 diabetes, where the evidence base is more developed. Larger-scale trials of telehealth-supported self-management, based on explicit self-management theory, are needed before the extent to which telehealth technologies may be harnessed to support self-management can be established.","['COPD', 'asthma', 'cancer', 'chronic disease', 'diabetes', 'heart failure', 'pulmonary disease, chronic obstructive', 'self-management', 'telehealth', 'telemonitoring']",Journal of medical Internet research,"10.2196/jmir.6688

165 patients with T2D were randomized 1:1 to telemedicine intervention as add-on to clinic-based care or control (clinic-based care). The intervention consisted of monthly video conferences with a nurse via a tablet computer and lasted for 32 weeks.

27842539,Desveaux et al.,A randomized wait-list control trial to evaluate the impact of a mobile application to improve self-management of individuals with type 2 diabetes: a study protocol.,"Management of diabetes through improved glycemic control and risk factor modification can help prevent long-term complications. Much diabetes management is self-management, in which healthcare providers play a supporting role. Well-designed e-Health solutions targeting behavior change can improve a range of measures, including glycemic control, perceived health, and a reduction in hospitalizations.
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate if a mobile application designed to improve self-management among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) improves glycemic control compared to usual care. The secondary objectives are to determine the effects on patient experience and health system costs; evaluate how and why the intervention worked as observed; and gain insight into considerations for system-wide scale-up. This pragmatic, randomized, wait-list-control trial will recruit adult participants from three Diabetes Education Programs in Ontario, Canada. The primary outcome is glycemic control (measured by HbA1c). Secondary outcomes include patient-reported outcomes and patient-reported experience measures, health system utilization, and intervention usability. The primary outcome will be analyzed using an ANCOVA, with continuous secondary outcomes analyzed using Poisson regression. Direct observations will be conducted of the implementation and application-specific training sessions provided to each site. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with participants, healthcare providers, organizational leaders, and system stakeholders as part of the embedded process evaluation. Thematic analysis will be applied to the qualitative data in order to describe the relationships between (a) key contextual factors, (b) the mechanisms by which they effect the implementation of the intervention, and (c) the impact on the outcomes of the intervention, according to the principles of Realist Evaluation.
The use of mobile health and virtual tools is on the rise in health care, but the evidence of their effectiveness is mixed and their evaluation is often lacking key contextual data. Results from this study will provide much needed information about the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a mobile application to improve diabetes self-management. The process evaluation will provide valuable insight into the contextual factors that influence the application effectiveness, which will inform the potential for adoption and scale.

27770591,Teljeur et al.,Economic evaluation of chronic disease self-management for people with diabetes: a systematic review.,"To systematically review the evidence on the costs and cost-effectiveness of self-management support interventions for people with diabetes.
Self-management support is the provision of education and supportive interventions to increase patients' skills and confidence in managing their health problems, potentially leading to improvements in HbA
Randomized controlled trials, observational studies or economic modelling studies were eligible for inclusion in the review. The target population was adults with diabetes. Interventions had to have a substantial component of self-management support and be compared with routine care. Study quality was evaluated using the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria and International Society of Pharmacoeconomic Outcomes Research questionnaires. A narrative review approach was used.
A total of 16 costing and 21 cost-effectiveness studies of a range of self-management support interventions were identified. There was reasonably consistent evidence across 22 studies evaluating education self-management support programmes suggesting these interventions are cost-effective or superior to usual care. Telemedicine-type interventions were more expensive than usual care and potentially not cost-effective. There was insufficient evidence regarding the other types of self-management interventions, including pharmacist-led and behavioural interventions. The identified studies were predominantly of poor quality, with outcomes based on short-term follow-up data and study designs at high risk of bias.
Self-management support education programmes may be cost-effective. There was limited evidence regarding other formats of self-management support interventions. The poor quality of many of the studies undermines the evidence base regarding the economic efficiency of self-management support interventions for people with diabetes.",[],Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,10.1111/dme.13281,2016-10-23,"[{'lastname': 'Teljeur', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Health Information and Quality Authority, Dublin, Ireland.\nDepartment of Public Health and Primary Care, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland.'}, {'lastname': 'Moran', 'firstname': 'P S', 'initials': 'PS', 'affiliation': 'Health Information and Quality Authority, Dublin, Ireland.'}, {'lastname': 'Walshe', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Health Information and Quality Authority, Dublin, Ireland.'}, {'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'S M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'HRB Centre for Primary Care Research, Department of General Practice, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.'}, {'lastname': 'Cianci', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health, Health Service Executive, Dublin, Ireland.'}, {'lastname': 'Murphy', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Health Information and Quality Authority, Dublin, Ireland.'}, {'lastname': 'Harrington', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Health Information and Quality Authority, Dublin, Ireland.'}, {'lastname': 'Ryan', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Health Information and Quality Authority, Dublin, Ireland.'}]",27770591,ca2a5a8d-0233-448e-84a0-d6d23766892a,,DENIED: Wiley E Publisher says no to https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/dme.13281/pdf

The aim of the study is to evaluate and compare the outcomes of wireless mobile device (Telemonitoring) with Pharmacist intervention and usual care on glycemic control and clinical outcomes.
This study is a six-month parallel groups interventional longitudinal multi-center study with a control arm. The study participants consist of patient diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and attending the outpatient department (OPD) for diabetic treatment. The study protocol is approved from ministry of health Malaysia and clinical research committee (CRC). Data analysis was made using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 22 (Armok, NY).
A total of 150 participants were selected to enroll in this study. Initial baseline comparison showed 'No significant difference' between the two intervention arms and control group. Findings showed that baseline dataset have no significant change among all three-arms. However last week of study showed significant (p<0.001) improvement among pharmacist intervention arm as compared to telemonitoring and control arm. Glycemic control seems well tolerated and managed among pharmacist intervention arm as compared to telemonitoring and control arm (p<0.001). The study findings also showed reduction of mean 2.72 % (HbA1c) as compare to baseline in six months. The proportion of participants experiencing hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events was significantly lower in the pharmacist intervention group compared to telemonitoring and control arm (odds ratio: 2.1381; 95% CI: 3.0267-1.6059, p<0.001).

27458809,Wild et al.,Supported Telemonitoring and Glycemic Control in People with Type 2 Diabetes: The Telescot Diabetes Pragmatic Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Self-monitoring of blood glucose among people with type 2 diabetes not treated with insulin does not appear to be effective in improving glycemic control. We investigated whether health professional review of telemetrically transmitted self-monitored glucose results in improved glycemic control in people with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes.
We performed a randomized, parallel, investigator-blind controlled trial with centralized randomization in family practices in four regions of the United Kingdom among 321 people with type 2 diabetes and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) >58 mmol/mol. The supported telemonitoring intervention involved self-measurement and transmission to a secure website of twice-weekly morning and evening glucose for review by family practice clinicians who were not blinded to allocation group. The control group received usual care, with at least annual review and more frequent reviews for people with poor glycemic or blood pressure control. HbA1c assessed at 9 mo was the primary outcome. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed. 160 people were randomized to the intervention group and 161 to the usual care group between June 6, 2011, and July 19, 2013. HbA1c data at follow-up were available for 146 people in the intervention group and 139 people in the control group. The mean (SD) HbA1c at follow-up was 63.0 (15.5) mmol/mol in the intervention group and 67.8 (14.7) mmol/mol in the usual care group. For primary analysis, adjusted mean HbA1c was 5.60 mmol/mol / 0.51% lower (95% CI 2.38 to 8.81 mmol/mol/ 95% CI 0.22% to 0.81%, p = 0·0007). For secondary analyses, adjusted mean ambulatory systolic blood pressure was 3.06 mmHg lower (95% CI 0.56-5.56 mmHg, p = 0.017) and mean ambulatory diastolic blood pressure was 2.17 mmHg lower (95% CI 0.62-3.72, p = 0.006) among people in the intervention group when compared with usual care after adjustment for baseline differences and minimization strata. No significant differences were identified between groups in weight, treatment pattern, adherence to medication, or quality of life in secondary analyses. There were few adverse events and these were equally distributed between the intervention and control groups. In secondary analysis, there was a greater number of telephone calls between practice nurses and patients in the intervention compared with control group (rate ratio 7.50 (95% CI 4.45-12.65, p < 0.0001) but no other significant differences between groups in use of health services were identified between groups. Key limitations include potential lack of representativeness of trial participants, inability to blind participants and health professionals, and uncertainty about the mechanism, the duration of the effect, and the optimal length of the intervention.
Supported telemonitoring resulted in clinically important improvements in control of glycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes in family practice. Current Controlled Trials, registration number ISRCTN71674628.

27379995,Dario et al.,Telemonitoring of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Italy.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) affects 382 million people worldwide.
This study aimed at assessing whether telemonitoring (TM) of DM patients improves health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
As part of the RENEWING HEALTH project, 299 DM patients with HbA1c >7.0% were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial, with 208 patients in the TM group and 91 patients in the usual-care group. TM electronically transmitted glucose measurements to physicians during a 12-month follow-up. The SF-36v2 questionnaire was used to assess HRQoL.
In a total of 243 patients analyzed, the study did not identify any clinically important improvement in HRQoL, our primary endpoint. There was no statistically significant difference in HbA1c between the two groups; however, outpatient visits and planned hospitalizations were significantly reduced in the TM group (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.02).
The results regarding HRQoL might be, at least in part, an artifact stemming from the criteria used to select patients. TM reduced ambulatory visits and planned hospital admissions, an important result that plausibly reflects the fact that clinicians can strictly monitor their patients' health status without face-to-face contacts.
Enhancement of HRQoL should represent the most critical goal of DM healthcare delivery. Effects of TM on HRQoL of diabetic patients should be studied further.","['blood glucose monitoring', 'chronic disease management', 'diabetes mellitus', 'health technology assessment', 'telemedicine', 'telemonitoring']",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,10.1089/tmj.2015.0224,2016-07-06,"[{'lastname': 'Dario', 'firstname': 'Claudio', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""1 Arsenàl.IT, Veneto's Research Centre for eHealth Innovation , Treviso, Italy .""}, {'lastname': 'Toffanin', 'firstname': 'Roberto', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': '2 Local Health Authority of Alto Vicentino , Thiene-Schio, Italy .'}, {'lastname': 'Calcaterra', 'firstname': 'Francesco', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': '2 Local Health Authority of Alto Vicentino , Thiene-Schio, Italy .'}, {'lastname': 'Saccavini', 'firstname': 'Claudio', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""1 Arsenàl.IT, Veneto's Research Centre for eHealth Innovation , Treviso, Italy .""}, {'lastname': 'Stafylas', 'firstname': 'Panagiotis', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': '3 HIM SA , Brussels, Belgium .'}, {'lastname': 'Mancin', 'firstname': 'Silvia', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""1 Arsenàl.IT, Veneto's Research Centre for eHealth Innovation , Treviso, Italy .""}, {'lastname': 'Vio', 'firstname': 'Elena', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': ""1 Arsenàl.IT, Veneto's Research Centre for eHealth Innovation , Treviso, Italy .""}]",27379995,ca2a5a8d-0233-448e-84a0-d6d23766892a,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Telemed J E Health"""
27194175,Basudev et al.,A prospective randomized controlled study of a virtual clinic integrating primary and specialist care for patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"To investigate the effectiveness of a diabetes virtual clinic to enhance diabetes in primary care by developing clinical management plans for patients with suboptimal metabolic control and/or case complexity.
A prospective study with randomized allocation to virtual clinic or usual care. Patients with Type 2 diabetes (n = 208) were recruited from six general practices in South London. The primary outcome for the study was glycaemic control, secondary outcomes included: lipids, blood pressure, weight (kg and BMI) and renal function (eGFR). Data were collected from participants' records at baseline and 12 months. We also considered process measures including therapy optimization.
The 12-month data show equivalence between the virtual clinic and control groups for glycaemic control with both achieving clinically significant reductions in HbA1c of 8 mmol/mol (0.6 ± 1.7%) and 10 mmol/mol (0.8 ± 1.9%), respectively (P = 0.4). The virtual clinic group showed superiority over the intervention group for blood pressure control with a mean reduction in systolic blood pressure of 6 ± 16 mmHg compared with an increased of 2 ± 18 mmHg in the control group (P = 0.008). There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of cholesterol, weight and renal function. Process measures showed an increased level of therapy adjustment in the virtual clinic group.
The virtual clinic model explored in this study showed a clinically important improvement in glycaemic control. Although this improvement was not superior to that observed in the control participants, this might be attributable to the systemic impact of the virtual clinic on the practice as a whole.",[],Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,10.1111/dme.12985,2016-05-20,"[{'lastname': 'Basudev', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': ""Lambeth Diabetes Intermediate Care Team, King's College London, London, UK.\nFlorence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery, King's College London, London, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Crosby-Nwaobi', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': ""Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery, King's College London, London, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Thomas', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""St Thomas's Hospital, London, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Chamley', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Lambeth Diabetes Intermediate Care Team, King's College London, London, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Murrells', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': ""Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery, King's College London, London, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Forbes', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery, King's College London, London, UK.""}]",27194175,ca2a5a8d-0233-448e-84a0-d6d23766892a,,DENIED: Wiley E Publisher says no to https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/dme.12985/pdf
27039300,Dobson et al.,Text message-based diabetes self-management support (SMS4BG): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.,"Addressing the increasing prevalence, and associated disease burden, of diabetes is a priority of health services internationally. Interventions to support patients to effectively self-manage their condition have the potential to reduce the risk of costly and debilitating complications. The utilisation of mobile phones to deliver self-management support allows for patient-centred care at the frequency and intensity that patients desire from outside the clinic environment. Self-Management Support for Blood Glucose (SMS4BG) is a novel text message-based intervention for supporting people with diabetes to improve self-management behaviours and achieve better glycaemic control and is tailored to individual patient preferences, demographics, clinical characteristics, and culture. This study aims to assess whether SMS4BG can improve glycaemic control in adults with poorly controlled diabetes. This paper outlines the rationale and methods of the trial.
A two-arm, parallel, randomised controlled trial will be conducted across New Zealand health districts. One thousand participants will be randomised at a 1:1 ratio to receive SMS4BG, a theoretically based and individually tailored automated text message-based diabetes self-management support programme (intervention) in addition to usual care, or usual care alone (control). The primary outcome is change in glycaemic control (HbA1c) at 9 months. Secondary outcomes include glycaemic control at 3 and 6 months, self-efficacy, self-care behaviours, diabetes distress, health-related quality of life, perceived social support, and illness perceptions. Cost information and healthcare utilisation will also be collected as well as intervention satisfaction and interaction.
This study will provide information on the effectiveness of a text message-based self-management support tool for people with diabetes. If found to be effective it has the potential to provide individualised support to people with diabetes across New Zealand (and internationally), thus extending care outside the clinic environment.

27005766,Lynch et al.,Tablet-Aided BehavioraL intervention EffecT on Self-management skills (TABLETS) for Diabetes.,"Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) show that behavioral lifestyle interventions are effective in improving diabetes management and that comprehensive risk factor management improves cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. The role of technology has been gaining strong support as evidence builds of its potential to improve diabetes management; however, evaluation of its impact in minority populations is limited. This study intends to provide early evidence of a theory-driven intervention, Tablet-Aided BehavioraL intervention EffecT on Self-management skills (TABLETS), using real-time videoconferencing for education and skills training. We examine the potential for TABLETS to improve health risk behaviors and reduce CVD risk outcomes among a low-income African American (AA) population with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes.
The study is a two-arm, pilot controlled trial that randomizes 30 participants to the TABLETS intervention and 30 participants to a usual care group. Blinded outcome assessments will be completed at baseline, 2.5 months (immediate post-intervention), and 6.5 months (follow-up). The TABLETS intervention consists of culturally tailored telephone-delivered diabetes education and skills training delivered via videoconferencing on tablet devices, with two booster sessions delivered via tablet-based videoconferencing at 3 months and 5 months to stimulate ongoing use of the tablet device with access to intervention materials via videoconferencing slides and a manual of supplementary materials. The primary outcomes are physical activity, diet, medication adherence, and self-monitoring behavior, whereas the secondary outcomes are HbA1c, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), BP, CVD risk, and quality of life.
This study provides a unique opportunity to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a theory-driven, tablet-aided behavioral intervention that utilizes real-time videoconferencing technology for education and skills training on self-management behaviors and quality of life among a high-risk, low-income AA population with an uncontrolled dyad or triad of CVD risk factors (diabetes with or without hypertension or hyperlipidemia). The intervention leverages the use of novel technology for education and skill-building to foster improved diabetes self-management. The findings of this study will inform the process of disseminating the intervention to a broader and larger sample of people and can potentially be refined to align with clinical workflows that target a subsample of patients with poor diabetes self-management.

26872105,Odnoletkova et al.,Optimizing diabetes control in people with Type 2 diabetes through nurse-led telecoaching.,"To study the effect of a target-driven telecoaching intervention on HbA1c and other modifiable risk factors in people with Type 2 diabetes.
We conducted a randomized controlled trial in patients receiving hypoglycaemic agents. The primary outcome was HbA1c level at 6 months in the entire sample and in a subgroup with HbA1c levels ≥ 53 mmol/mol (7%) at baseline. Secondary outcomes were HbA1c at 18 months; total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, blood pressure, BMI and proportion of people who had achieved guideline-recommended targets at 6 and 18 months.
A total of 287 participants were randomized to telecoaching and 287 to usual care. The mean (sd) baseline HbA1c level was 53 (11) mmol/mol [7.0 (1.0)%] overall and 63 (10) mmol/mol [7.9 (0.9)%] in the elevated HbA1c subgroup. At 6 months, the between-group differences in favour of telecoaching were: HbA1c -2 (95% CI -4; -1) mmol/mol [-0.2 (95% CI -0.3;-0.1)%; P=0.003] overall and -4 (95% CI -7; -2) mmol/mol [-0.4 (95% CI -0.7; -0.2)%; P=0.001] in the elevated HbA1c subgroup; BMI -0.4 kg/m(2) (95% CI -0.6; -0.1; P=0.003); total cholesterol -6 mg/dl (95% CI -11; -1, P=0.012). The proportion of participants on target for the composite of HbA1c , LDL and blood pressure increased by 8.9% in the intervention group and decreased by 1.3% in the control group (P=0.011). At 18 months, the difference in HbA1c was: -2 (95% CI -3;-0) mmol/mol [-0.2 (95% CI -0.3; -0.0)%; P=0.046] overall and -4 (-7; -1) mmol/mol [-0.4 (95% CI -0.7; -0.1)%; P=0.023] in the elevated HbA1c subgroup.

26540163,Crowley et al.,Practical Telemedicine for Veterans with Persistently Poor Diabetes Control: A Randomized Pilot Trial.,"Telemedicine-based diabetes management improves outcomes versus clinic care but is seldom implemented by healthcare systems. In order to advance telemedicine-based management as a practical option for veterans with persistent poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (PPDM) despite clinic-based care, we evaluated a comprehensive telemedicine intervention that we specifically designed for delivery using existing Veterans Health Administration (VHA) clinical staffing and equipment.
We conducted a 6-month randomized trial among 50 veterans with PPDM; all maintained hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels continuously >9.0% for >1 year despite clinic-based management. Participants received usual care or a telemedicine intervention combining telemonitoring, medication management, self-management support, and depression management; existing VHA clinical staff delivered the intervention. Using linear mixed models, we examined HbA1c, diabetes self-care (measured by the Self-Care Inventory-Revised questionnaire), depression, and blood pressure.
At baseline, the model-estimated common HbA1c intercept was 10.5%. By 6 months, estimated HbA1c had improved by 1.3% for intervention participants and 0.3% for usual care (estimated difference, -1.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.0%, 0.0%; p = 0.050). Intervention participants' diabetes self-care (estimated difference, 7.0; 95% CI, 0.1, 14.0; p = 0.047), systolic blood pressure (-7.7 mm Hg; 95% CI, -14.8, -0.6; p = 0.035), and diastolic blood pressure (-5.6 mm Hg; 95% CI, -9.9, -1.2; p = 0.013) were improved versus usual care by 6 months. Depressive symptoms were similar between groups.
A comprehensive telemedicine intervention improved outcomes among veterans with PPDM despite clinic-based care. Because we specifically designed this intervention with scalability in mind, it may represent a practical, real-world strategy to reduce the burden of poor diabetes control among veterans.","['e-health', 'home health monitoring', 'telehealth', 'telemedicine']",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,10.1089/tmj.2015.0145,2015-11-06,"[{'lastname': 'Crowley', 'firstname': 'Matthew J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': '1 Center for Health Services Research in Primary Care, Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center , Durham, North Carolina.\n2 Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, Duke University , Durham, North Carolina.'}, {'lastname': 'Edelman', 'firstname': 'David', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': '1 Center for Health Services Research in Primary Care, Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center , Durham, North Carolina.\n3 Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Duke University , Durham, North Carolina.'}, {'lastname': 'McAndrew', 'firstname': 'Ann T', 'initials': 'AT', 'affiliation': '4 Home Telehealth Program, Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center , Durham, North Carolina.'}, {'lastname': 'Kistler', 'firstname': 'Susan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': '4 Home Telehealth Program, Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center , Durham, North Carolina.'}, {'lastname': 'Danus', 'firstname': 'Susanne', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': '1 Center for Health Services Research in Primary Care, Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center , Durham, North Carolina.'}, {'lastname': 'Webb', 'firstname': 'Jason A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': '3 Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Duke University , Durham, North Carolina.\n5 Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Medicine, Duke University , Durham, North Carolina.\n6 Mental Health Service, Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center , Durham, North Carolina.'}, {'lastname': 'Zanga', 'firstname': 'Joseph', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': '3 Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Duke University , Durham, North Carolina.\n5 Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Medicine, Duke University , Durham, North Carolina.\n6 Mental Health Service, Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center , Durham, North Carolina.'}, {'lastname': 'Sanders', 'firstname': 'Linda L', 'initials': 'LL', 'affiliation': '3 Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Duke University , Durham, North Carolina.'}, {'lastname': 'Coffman', 'firstname': 'Cynthia J', 'initials': 'CJ', 'affiliation': '1 Center for Health Services Research in Primary Care, Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center , Durham, North Carolina.\n7 Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Duke University Medical Center , Durham, North Carolina.'}, {'lastname': 'Jackson', 'firstname': 'George L', 'initials': 'GL', 'affiliation': '1 Center for Health Services Research in Primary Care, Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center , Durham, North Carolina.\n3 Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Duke University , Durham, North Carolina.'}, {'lastname': 'Bosworth', 'firstname': 'Hayden B', 'initials': 'HB', 'affiliation': '1 Center for Health Services Research in Primary Care, Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center , Durham, North Carolina.\n3 Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Duke University , Durham, North Carolina.'}]",26540163,ca2a5a8d-0233-448e-84a0-d6d23766892a,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Telemed J E Health"""
26468213,"Rasmussen, Lauszus, Loekke",Telemedicine compared with standard care in type 2 diabetes mellitus: A randomized trial in an outpatient clinic.,"Good metabolic control is important in type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve quality of life, work ability and life expectancy, and the use of telemedicine has proved efficient as an add-on to the usual treatment. However, few studies in type 2 diabetes patients have directly compared telemedicine with conventional outpatient treatment, and we wanted to evaluate whether telemedicine, compared with standard care, provides equivalent clinical outcomes.
Forty patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus allocated from October 2011-July 2012 were randomized to either treatment at home by video conferences only or standard outpatient treatment. Primary outcomes were HbA1c and blood glucose levels and secondary outcomes were 24-hour blood pressure, cholesterol levels and albuminuria. The video-telephone was a broadband solution installed and serviced by the Danish Telephone Company (TDC).
The improvements in the two treatments, given as changes in percentage of telemedicine vs standard, showed significant differences in HbA1c (-15 vs -11%), mean blood glucose (-18 vs -13%) and in cholesterol (-7 vs -6%). No differences in LDL (-4 vs -6%), weight (-1 vs 2%), diastolic diurnal blood pressure (-1 vs -7%), and systolic diurnal blood pressure (0 vs -1%) were found. Nine consultations were missed in the standard outpatient group and none in the telemedicine group.
In the direct comparison of home video consultations vs standard outpatient treatment in type 2 diabetes mellitus, telemedicine was a safe and available option with favourable outcomes after six months treatment.","['Remote consultation', 'Telecare', 'Teleconsulting', 'Telehealth', 'Telemedicine']",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,10.1177/1357633X15608984,2015-10-16,"[{'lastname': 'Rasmussen', 'firstname': 'Ole W', 'initials': 'OW', 'affiliation': 'Medical Department, Kolding Hospital, Denmark ole.winther.rasmussen@rsyd.dk.'}, {'lastname': 'Lauszus', 'firstname': 'F F', 'initials': 'FF', 'affiliation': 'Gynecological Department, Herning Hospital, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Loekke', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Medical Department, Kolding Hospital, Denmark.'}]",26468213,ca2a5a8d-0233-448e-84a0-d6d23766892a,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""J Telemed Telecare"""
26199142,Greenwood et al.,Overcoming Clinical Inertia: A Randomized Clinical Trial of a Telehealth Remote Monitoring Intervention Using Paired Glucose Testing in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a worldwide challenge. Practice guidelines promote structured self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) for informing health care providers about glycemic control and providing patient feedback to increase knowledge, self-efficacy, and behavior change. Paired glucose testing—pairs of glucose results obtained before and after a meal or physical activity—is a method of structured SMBG. However, frequent access to glucose data to interpret values and recommend actions is challenging. A complete feedback loop—data collection and interpretation combined with feedback to modify treatment—has been associated with improved outcomes, yet there remains limited integration of SMBG feedback in diabetes management. Incorporating telehealth remote monitoring and asynchronous electronic health record (EHR) feedback from certified diabetes educators (CDEs)—specialists in glucose pattern management—employ the complete feedback loop to improve outcomes.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate a telehealth remote monitoring intervention using paired glucose testing and asynchronous data analysis in adults with type 2 diabetes. The primary aim was change in glycated hemoglobin (A(1c))—a measure of overall glucose management—between groups after 6 months. The secondary aims were change in self-reported Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA), Diabetes Empowerment Scale, and Diabetes Knowledge Test.
A 2-group randomized clinical trial was conducted comparing usual care to telehealth remote monitoring with paired glucose testing and asynchronous virtual visits. Participants were aged 30-70 years, not using insulin with A1c levels between 7.5% and 10.9% (58-96 mmol/mol). The telehealth remote monitoring tablet computer transmitted glucose data and facilitated a complete feedback loop to educate participants, analyze actionable glucose data, and provide feedback. Data from paired glucose testing were analyzed asynchronously using computer-assisted pattern analysis and were shared with patients via the EHR weekly. CDEs called participants monthly to discuss paired glucose testing trends and treatment changes. Separate mixed-effects models were used to analyze data.
Participants (N=90) were primarily white (64%, 56/87), mean age 58 (SD 11) years, mean body mass index 34.1 (SD 6.7) kg/m2, with diabetes for mean 8.2 (SD 5.4) years, and a mean A(1c) of 8.3% (SD 1.1; 67 mmol/mol). Both groups lowered A(1c) with an estimated average decrease of 0.70 percentage points in usual care group and 1.11 percentage points in the treatment group with a significant difference of 0.41 percentage points at 6 months (SE 0.08, t159=-2.87, P=.005). Change in medication (SE 0.21, t157=-3.37, P=.009) was significantly associated with lower A(1c) level. The treatment group significantly improved on the SDSCA subscales carbohydrate spacing (P=.04), monitoring glucose (P=.001), and foot care (P=.02).
An eHealth model incorporating a complete feedback loop with telehealth remote monitoring and paired glucose testing with asynchronous data analysis significantly improved A(1c) levels compared to usual care.

25425504,Williams et al.,Technology-Intensified Diabetes Education Study (TIDES) in African Americans with type 2 diabetes: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"Compared to American Whites, African Americans have a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), experiencing poorer metabolic control and greater risks for complications and death. Patient-level factors, such as diabetes knowledge, self-management skills, empowerment, and perceived control, account for >90% of the variance observed in outcomes between these racial groups. There is strong evidence that self-management interventions that include telephone-delivered diabetes education and skills training are effective at improving metabolic control in diabetes. Web-based home telemonitoring systems in conjunction with active care management are also effective ways to lower glycosylated hemoglobin A1c values when compared to standard care, and provide feedback to patients; however, there are no studies in African Americans with poorly controlled T2DM that examine the use of technology-based feedback to tailor or augment diabetes education and skills training. This study provides a unique opportunity to address this gap in the literature.
We describe an ongoing 4-year randomized clinical trial, which will test the efficacy of a technology-intensified diabetes education and skills training (TIDES) intervention in African Americans with poorly controlled T2DM. Two hundred male and female AfricanAmerican participants, 21 years of age or older and with a glycosylated hemoglobin A1c level ≥ 8%, will be randomized into one of two groups for 12 weeks of telephone interventions: (1) TIDES intervention group or (2) a usual-care group. Participants will be followed for 12 months to ascertain the effect of the interventions on glycemic control. Our primary hypothesis is that, among African Americans with poorly controlled T2DM, patients randomized to the TIDES intervention will have significantly greater reduction in glycosylated hemoglobin A1c at 12 months of follow-up compared to the usual-care group.
Results from this study will add to the current literature examining how best to deliver diabetes education and skills training and provide important insight into effective strategies to improve metabolic control and hence reduce diabetes complications and mortality rates in African Americans with poorly controlled T2DM.

25227131,Huang et al.,Management of endocrine disease. Effects of telecare intervention on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"To review the published literature on the effects of telecare intervention in patients with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control.
A review of randomized controlled trials on telecare intervention in patients with type 2 diabetes, and a search of electronic databases such as The Cochrane Library, PubMed, EBSCO, CINAHL, Science Direct, Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), were conducted from December 8 to 16, 2013. Two evaluators independently selected and reviewed the eligible studies. Changes in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), post-prandial plasma glucose (PPG), BMI, and body weight were analyzed.
An analysis of 18 studies with 3798 subjects revealed that telecare significantly improved the management of diabetes. Mean HbA1c values were reduced by -0.54 (95% CI, -0.75 to -0.34; P<0.05), mean FPG levels by -9.00 mg/dl (95% CI, -17.36 to -0.64; P=0.03), and mean PPG levels reduced by -52.86 mg/dl (95% CI, -77.13 to -28.58; P<0.05) when compared with the group receiving standard care.

25100190,Steventon et al.,Effect of telehealth on glycaemic control: analysis of patients with type 2 diabetes in the Whole Systems Demonstrator cluster randomised trial.,"The Whole Systems Demonstrator was a large, pragmatic, cluster randomised trial that compared telehealth with usual care among 3,230 patients with long-term conditions in three areas of England. Telehealth involved the regular transmission of physiological information such as blood glucose to health professionals working remotely. We examined whether telehealth led to changes in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) among the subset of patients with type 2 diabetes.
The general practice electronic medical record was used as the source of information on HbA1c. Effects on HbA1c were assessed using a repeated measures model that included all HbA1c readings recorded during the 12-month trial period, and adjusted for differences in HbA1c readings recorded before recruitment. Secondary analysis averaged multiple HbA1c readings recorded for each individual during the trial period.
513 of the 3,230 participants were identified as having type 2 diabetes and thus were included in the study. Telehealth was associated with lower HbA1c than usual care during the trial period (difference 0.21% or 2.3 mmol/mol, 95% CI, 0.04% to 0.38%, p = 0.013). Among the 457 patients in the secondary analysis, mean HbA1c showed little change for controls following recruitment, but fell for intervention patients from 8.38% to 8.15% (68 to 66 mmol/mol). A higher proportion of intervention patients than controls had HbA1c below the 7.5% (58 mmol/mol) threshold that was targeted by general practices (30.4% vs. 38.0%). This difference, however, did not quite reach statistical significance (adjusted odds ratio 1.63, 95% CI, 0.99 to 2.68, p = 0.053).
Telehealth modestly improved glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes over 12 months. The scale of the improvements is consistent with previous meta-analyses, but was relatively modest and seems unlikely to produce significant patient benefit.

Participants (n = 118) included adult patients with Type 2 diabetes cared for by community physicians. Intervention patients received mobile phone coaching and individualized web portal. Control patients received usual care. Patients were stratified into two age groups: younger (<55 years) and older (≥ 55 years). The intervention resulted in greater 12-month declines in HbA1c, compared with usual care, for patients in both age groups (p < .0001). Among older patients, HbA1c changed by -1.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = [-2.4, -1.1]) in the intervention group and -0.3% (95% CI = [-0.9, +0.3]) in the control group. Among younger patients, HbA1c changed by -2.0% (95% CI = [-2.5, -1.5]) in the intervention group and -1.0% (95% CI = [-1.6, -0.4]) in the control group.

24503043,Gordon et al.,A cost-effectiveness analysis of a telephone-linked care intervention for individuals with Type 2 diabetes.,"To assess the cost-effectiveness of an automated telephone-linked care intervention, Australian TLC Diabetes, delivered over 6 months to patients with established Type 2 diabetes mellitus and high glycated haemoglobin level, compared to usual care.
A Markov model was designed to synthesize data from a randomized controlled trial of TLC Diabetes (n=120) and other published evidence. The 5-year model consisted of three health states related to glycaemic control: 'sub-optimal' HbA1c ≥58mmol/mol (7.5%); 'average' ≥48-57mmol/mol (6.5-7.4%) and 'optimal' <48mmol/mol (6.5%) and a fourth state 'all-cause death'. Key outcomes of the model include discounted health system costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYS) using SF-6D utility weights. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken.
Annual medication costs for the intervention group were lower than usual care [
£1076 (95%CI: £947, £1206) versus usual care £1271 (95%CI: £1115, £1428) p=0.052]. The estimated mean cost for intervention group participants over five years, including the intervention cost, was £17,152 versus £17,835 for the usual care group. The corresponding mean QALYs were 3.381 (SD 0.40) for the intervention group and 3.377 (SD 0.41) for the usual care group. Results were sensitive to the model duration, utility values and medication costs.
The Australian TLC Diabetes intervention was a low-cost investment for individuals with established diabetes and may result in medication cost-savings to the health system. Although QALYs were similar between groups, other benefits arising from the intervention should also be considered when determining the overall value of this strategy.","['Cost-effectiveness analysis', 'Tele-health', 'Type 2 diabetes']",Diabetes research and clinical practice,10.1016/j.diabres.2013.12.032,2014-02-08,"[{'lastname': 'Gordon', 'firstname': 'L G', 'initials': 'LG', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Applied Health Economics, Griffith Health Institute, Griffith University, University Dr, Meadowbrook, Queensland, Australia.

24495633,Odnoletkova et al.,"Nurse-led telecoaching of people with type 2 diabetes in primary care: rationale, design and baseline data of a randomized controlled trial.","Despite the efforts of the healthcare community to improve the quality of diabetes care, about 50% of people with type 2 diabetes do not reach their treatment targets, increasing the risk of future micro-and macro-vascular complications. Diabetes self-management education has been shown to contribute to better disease control. However, it is not known which strategies involving educational programs are cost-effective. Telehealth applications might support chronic disease management. Transferability of successful distant patient self-management support programs to the Belgian setting needs to be confirmed by studies of a high methodological quality. ""The COACH Program"" was developed in Australia as target driven educational telephone delivered intervention to support people with different chronic conditions. It proved to be effective in patients with coronary heart disease after hospitalization. Clinical and cost-effectiveness of The COACH Program in people with type 2 diabetes in Belgium needs to be assessed.
Randomized controlled trial in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients were selected based on their medication consumption data and were recruited by their sickness fund. They were randomized to receive either usual care plus ""The COACH Program"" or usual care alone. The study will assess the difference in outcomes between groups. The primary outcome measure is the level of HbA1c. The secondary outcomes are: Total Cholesterol, LDL-Cholesterol, HDL-Cholesterol, Triglycerides, Blood Pressure, body mass index, smoking status; proportion of people at target for HbA1c, LDL-Cholesterol and Blood Pressure; self-perceived health status, diabetes-specific emotional distress and satisfaction with diabetes care. The follow-up period is 18 months. Within-trial and modeled cost-utility analyses, to project effects over life-time horizon beyond the trial duration, will be undertaken from the perspective of the health care system if the intervention is effective.
The study will enhance our understanding of the potential of telehealth in diabetes management in Belgium. Research on the clinical effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness is essential to support policy makers in future reimbursement and implementation decisions.",[],BMC family practice,"10.1186/1471-2296-15-24

24404816,Pressman et al.,A novel telemonitoring device for improving diabetes control: protocol and results from a randomized clinical trial.,"Telemedicine is one approach to managing patients with chronic illness. Several telephone-based monitoring studies of diabetes patients have shown improved glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), blood pressure (BP), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels. The purpose of this study was to evaluate an investigational in-home telemetry device for improving glucose and BP control over 6 months for patients with type 2 diabetes. The device was used to transmit weekly blood glucose, weight, and BP readings to a diabetes care manager.
We conducted a two-arm, parallel-comparison, single-blind, randomized controlled trial among Kaiser Permanente Northern California members 18-75 years old with type 2 diabetes mellitus and entry HbA1c levels between 7.5% and 10.0%. Participants were randomly assigned to either the telemonitoring arm or the usual care arm.
We observed very small, nonsignificant changes in fructosamine (telemonitoring, -54.9 μmol; usual care, -59.4 μmol) and systolic BP (telemonitoring, -6.3 mm Hg; usual care, -3.2 mm Hg) from baseline to 6 weeks in both groups. At 6 months, we observed no significant intergroup differences in change from baseline for HbA1c, fructosamine, or self-efficacy. However, LDL cholesterol in the telemonitoring arm decreased more than in the usual care arm (-17.1 mg/dL versus -5.4 mg/dL; P=0.045).
Although HbA1c improved significantly over 6 months in both groups, the difference in improvement between the groups was not significant. This lack of significance may be due to the relatively healthy status of the volunteers in our study and to the high level of care provided by the care managers in the Santa Rosa, CA clinic.

24355450,Hansen et al.,Effects of telemedicine in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes--a study protocol.,"Despite rehabilitation programmes offered to all patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes in Denmark, a number of patients either never accomplish good diabetes regulation or the regulation deteriorates with time. Therefore, new approaches are needed. The aim of the present study is to examine whether telemedicine conferences with a nurse can contribute to achieving good diabetes control among patients with poorly regulated type 2 diabetes.
A total of 165 patients with type 2 diabetes who have formerly undergone a rehabilitation programme are randomized to either telemedicine intervention or usual care. The intervention lasts for 32 weeks and consists of monthly videoconferences with a nurse from a health-care centre as an add-on to usual care. Blood sugar, blood pressure and weight are regularly self-monitored and measurements are automatically transferred to a database. Glycaemic control (HbA1c level) is examined at baseline, 16 weeks, 32 weeks and 58 weeks (six months post intervention). Blood pressure, weight, waist/hip ratio, quality of life, physical activity, lipids, creatinine and haemoglobin are examined at baseline and after 32 weeks.
The study will examine whether telemedicine technology can contribute to achieving good diabetes regulation.
The City of Copenhagen and the Prevention Fund of the Capital Region of Denmark funded the project. Also ""Smedemester Niels Hansen og Hustru Johanne F. Frederiksens Legat"" has supported the study.

Effective approaches to supporting self-management are required. The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to establish whether supported telemetric monitoring of glycemic control and blood pressure results in reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c; the primary outcome of a measure of long-term glycemic control) and secondary outcomes of blood pressure and weight among people with poorly controlled diabetes compared to a control group receiving usual care.
Design: multi-center, randomized controlled trial with embedded qualitative study. Setting: primary care in Lothian, Kent, Glasgow and Borders regions in the UK. Participants: people with type 2 diabetes and confirmed HbA1c>7.5% (58 mmol/mol). Intervention/comparison: randomization to intervention or control groups will be performed by the Edinburgh Clinical Trials Unit. Participants in the intervention group will be shown how to use blood glucose and blood pressure monitors and weighing scales which use Bluetooth wireless technology to transmit readings via modem to a remote server. These participants will be asked to provide at least twice weekly measurements of morning and evening blood glucose and weekly measurements of weight and blood pressure. Measurements will be checked at least weekly by practice nurses who will contact the patients to adjust therapy according to guidelines and reinforce lifestyle advice. Participants in the control group will receive usual care. All participants will receive an individual education session. Follow-up: measurements will be performed at practices 9 months after randomization by research nurses blinded to allocation. The primary outcome measure is HbA1c and secondary outcomes measure are daytime systolic and diastolic blood pressure, weight and cost per quality-adjusted life year. Analysis: intention-to-treat analyses will be performed. The sample size of 320 participants allows for 20% drop-out and has 80% power at 5% significance to detect a 0.5% absolute (6 mmol/mol) fall in HbA1c in the intervention group. The qualitative study will explore the experiences of patients and professionals using the intervention.

22857017,Williams et al.,"Randomised controlled trial of an automated, interactive telephone intervention (TLC Diabetes) to improve type 2 diabetes management: baseline findings and six-month outcomes.","Effective self-management of diabetes is essential for the reduction of diabetes-related complications, as global rates of diabetes escalate.
Randomised controlled trial. Adults with type 2 diabetes (n = 120), with HbA1c greater than or equal to 7.5 %, were randomly allocated (4 × 4 block randomised block design) to receive an automated, interactive telephone-delivered management intervention or usual routine care. Baseline sociodemographic, behavioural and medical history data were collected by self-administered questionnaires and biological data were obtained during hospital appointments. Health-related quality of life (HRQL) was measured using the SF-36.
The mean age of participants was 57.4 (SD 8.3), 63% of whom were male. There were no differences in demographic, socioeconomic and behavioural variables between the study arms at baseline. Over the six-month period from baseline, participants receiving the Australian TLC (Telephone-Linked Care) Diabetes program showed a 0.8% decrease in geometric mean HbA(1c) from 8.7% to 7.9%, compared with a 0.2% HbA(1c) reduction (8.9% to 8.7%) in the usual care arm (p = 0.002). There was also a significant improvement in mental HRQL, with a mean increase of 1.9 in the intervention arm, while the usual care arm decreased by 0.8 (p = 0.007). No significant improvements in physical HRQL were observed.
These analyses indicate the efficacy of the Australian TLC Diabetes program with clinically significant post-intervention improvements in both glycaemic control and mental HRQL. These observed improvements, if supported and maintained by an ongoing program such as this, could significantly reduce diabetes-related complications in the longer term. Given the accessibility and feasibility of this kind of program, it has strong potential for providing effective, ongoing support to many individuals with diabetes in the future.",[],BMC public health,"10.1186/1471-2458-12-602

22762449,Trief et al.,"Adherence to diabetes self care for white, African-American and Hispanic American telemedicine participants: 5 year results from the IDEATel project.","Adherence to diabetes self care is poor for Hispanic American and African-American patients. This study examined the change in adherence over time and in response to a telemedicine intervention for elderly diabetes patients in these groups compared to white diabetes patients. We also examined whether adherence mediated the effect of the intervention on glycemic control (A1c).
The Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine project randomized medically underserved Medicare patients (n=1665) to telemedicine case management (televideo educator visits, individualized goal-setting/problem solving) or usual care. Hispanic and African-American educators delivered the intervention in Spanish if needed.
Annual assessment included A1c and self-reported adherence (Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities scale). A simple model (only time and group terms) and a model with covariates (e.g., age) were examined for baseline and 5 years of follow-up. SAS PROC Mixed was used with non-linear terms to examine mediating effects of adherence on A1c, by performing tests of the mediating path coefficients.
Over time, self-reported adherence improved for the treatment group compared to usual care (p<0.001). There was no significant interaction with racial/ethnic group membership, i.e., all groups improved. However, minority subjects were consistently less adherent than whites. Also, greater comorbidity and diabetes symptoms predicted poorer adherence, greater duration of diabetes and more years of education predicted better adherence. Adherence was a significant mediator of A1c (p<0.001).
A unique, tailored telemedicine intervention was effective in achieving improved adherence to diabetes self care. However, African-American and Hispanic American participants were less adherent than white participants at all time points despite an individualized and accessible intervention. The finding that adherence did mediate glycemic control suggests that unique interventions for minority groups may be needed to overcome this disparity.",[],Ethnicity & health,10.1080/13557858.2012.700915,2012-07-06,"[{'lastname': 'Trief', 'firstname': 'Paula M', 'initials': 'PM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY, USA. triefp@upstate.edu'}, {'lastname': 'Izquierdo', 'firstname': 'Roberto', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Eimicke', 'firstname': 'Joseph P', 'initials': 'JP', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Teresi', 'firstname': 'Jeanne A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Goland', 'firstname': 'Robin', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Palmas', 'firstname': 'Walter', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Shea', 'firstname': 'Steven', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Weinstock', 'firstname': 'Ruth S', 'initials': 'RS', 'affiliation': None}]",22762449,ca2a5a8d-0233-448e-84a0-d6d23766892a,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Ethn Health"""

Participants were 2169 persons 55 years and older with type 2 diabetes from New York City and Upstate New York.
The diabetes case management intervention was implemented by a diabetes nurse, via a telemedicine unit in the participant's home, and in coordination with the primary care physician.
Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), were measured at a baseline visit and at up to 5 annual follow-up visits. Global cognition was measured at those visits with the Comprehensive Assessment and Referral Evaluation (CARE).
In mixed models the intervention was related to slower global cognitive decline in the intervention group (p = 0.01). Improvements in HbA1c (p = 0.03), but not SBP or LDL, mediated the effect of the intervention on cognitive decline.

21270184,Weinstock et al.,Glycemic control and health disparities in older ethnically diverse underserved adults with diabetes: five-year results from the Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine (IDEATel) study.,"The Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine (IDEATel) project randomized ethnically diverse underserved older adults with diabetes to a telemedicine intervention or usual care. Intervention participants had lower A1C levels over 5 years. New analyses were performed to help better understand this difference.
IDEATel randomized Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes (n = 1,665) to receive home video visits with a diabetes educator and upload glucose levels every 4-6 weeks or usual care (2000-2007). Annual measurements included BMI, A1C (primary outcome), and completion of questionnaires. Mixed-model analyses were performed using random effects to adjust for clustering within primary care physicians.
At baseline, A1C levels (mean ± SD) were 7.02 ± 1.25% in non-Hispanic whites (n = 821), 7.58 ± 1.78% in non-Hispanic blacks (n = 248), and 7.79 ± 1.68% in Hispanics (n = 585). Over time, lower A1C levels were associated with more glucose uploads (P = 0.02) and female sex (P = 0.002). Blacks, Hispanics, and insulin-users had higher A1C levels than non-Hispanic whites (P < 0.0001). BMI was not associated with A1C levels. Blacks and Hispanics had significantly fewer uploads than non-Hispanic whites over time. Hispanics had the highest baseline A1C levels and showed the greatest improvement in the intervention, but, unlike non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics did not achieve A1C levels <7.0% at 5 years.
Racial/ethnic disparities were observed in this cohort of underserved older adults with diabetes. The IDEATel telemedicine intervention was associated with improvement in glycemic control, particularly in Hispanics, who had the highest baseline A1C levels, suggesting that telemedicine has the potential to help reduce disparities in diabetes management.",[],Diabetes care,10.2337/dc10-1346,2011-01-29,"[{'lastname': 'Weinstock', 'firstname': 'Ruth S', 'initials': 'RS', 'affiliation': 'SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York, USA. weinstor@upstate.edu'}, {'lastname': 'Teresi', 'firstname': 'Jeanne A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Goland', 'firstname': 'Robin', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Izquierdo', 'firstname': 'Roberto', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Palmas', 'firstname': 'Walter', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Eimicke', 'firstname': 'Joseph P', 'initials': 'JP', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ebner', 'firstname': 'Susana', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Shea', 'firstname': 'Steven', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]","21270184

20678233,Eakin et al.,"Living Well with Diabetes: a randomized controlled trial of a telephone-delivered intervention for maintenance of weight loss, physical activity and glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes.","By 2025, it is estimated that approximately 1.8 million Australian adults (approximately 8.4% of the adult population) will have diabetes, with the majority having type 2 diabetes. Weight management via improved physical activity and diet is the cornerstone of type 2 diabetes management. However, the majority of weight loss trials in diabetes have evaluated short-term, intensive clinic-based interventions that, while producing short-term outcomes, have failed to address issues of maintenance and broad population reach. Telephone-delivered interventions have the potential to address these gaps.
Using a two-arm randomised controlled design, this study will evaluate an 18-month, telephone-delivered, behavioural weight loss intervention focussing on physical activity, diet and behavioural therapy, versus usual care, with follow-up at 24 months. Three-hundred adult participants, aged 20-75 years, with type 2 diabetes, will be recruited from 10 general practices via electronic medical records search. The Social-Cognitive Theory driven intervention involves a six-month intensive phase (4 weekly calls and 11 fortnightly calls) and a 12-month maintenance phase (one call per month). Primary outcomes, assessed at 6, 18 and 24 months, are: weight loss, physical activity, and glycaemic control (HbA1c), with weight loss and physical activity also measured at 12 months. Incremental cost-effectiveness will also be examined. Study recruitment began in February 2009, with final data collection expected by February 2013.
This is the first study to evaluate the telephone as the primary method of delivering a behavioural weight loss intervention in type 2 diabetes. The evaluation of maintenance outcomes (6 months following the end of intervention), the use of accelerometers to objectively measure physical activity, and the inclusion of a cost-effectiveness analysis will advance the science of broad reach approaches to weight control and health behaviour change, and will build the evidence base needed to advocate for the translation of this work into population health practice.

20556536,Anderson et al.,Managing the space between visits: a randomized trial of disease management for diabetes in a community health center.,"Diabetes outcomes are worse for underserved patients from certain ethnic/racial minority populations. Telephonic disease management is a cost-effective strategy to deliver self-management services and possibly improve diabetes outcomes for such patients.
We conducted a trial to test the effectiveness of a supplemental telephonic disease management program compared to usual care alone for patients with diabetes cared for in a community health center.
Randomized controlled trial.
All patients had type 2 diabetes, and the majority was Hispanic or African American. Most were urban-dwelling with low socioeconomic status, and nearly all had Medicaid or were uninsured.
Clinical measures included glycemic control, blood pressure, lipid levels, and body mass index. Validated surveys were used to measure dietary habits and physical activity.
A total of 146 patients were randomized to the intervention and 149 to the control group. Depressive symptoms were highly prevalent in both groups. Using an intention to treat analysis, there were no significant differences in the primary outcome (HbA1c) between the intervention and control groups at 12 months. There were also no significant differences for secondary clinical or behavioral outcome measures including BMI, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, smoking, or intake of fruits and vegetables, or physical activity.
A clinic-based telephonic disease management support for underserved patients with diabetes did not improve clinical or behavioral outcomes at 1 year as compared to patients receiving usual care alone.",[],Journal of general internal medicine,"10.1007/s11606-010-1419-5

20151772,Izquierdo et al.,Telemedicine intervention effects on waist circumference and body mass index in the IDEATel project.,"We examine the changes in waist circumference (WC) and body mass index (BMI) in older adults enrolled in a diabetes telemedicine program. The subjects were elderly Medicare beneficiaries participating in the rural (upstate New York) cohort of Informatics and Diabetes Education and Telemedicine, a randomized, controlled trial using telemedicine to improve diabetes care in which the primary outcome was glycemic control.
Ninety-two percent of the subjects had BMI >25 kg/m(2), and 65.8% had a BMI > or =30 kg/m(2). Intervention subjects received home televisits with a dietitian or nurse educator every 4-6 weeks. Blood glucose and blood pressure values were reviewed, and lifestyle and medication changes were recommended. Non-intervention subjects received usual care through their primary care physicians. Change in WC, BMI, diet, and exercise behaviors and knowledge were examined at baseline and 12 and 24 months. A mixed-effects path analysis was performed to examine direct and indirect effects.
The telemedicine participants increased diet and exercise knowledge over time (P < 0.001). It was estimated that women in the telemedicine group reduced their WC over the 2 years by 1.2 cm, whereas women in the usual care group increased their WC by almost 1 cm (P = 0.02). Path analysis demonstrated that the intervention, through improved diet and exercise knowledge, was related to the decrease in WC (P = 0.006) and BMI (P = 0.004).
Diabetes case management using telemedicine improved self-reported diet and exercise knowledge, practices, and behaviors, which in turn was associated with reductions in WC and BMI at 2 years.",[],Diabetes technology & therapeutics,10.1089/dia.2009.0102,2010-02-16,"[{'lastname': 'Izquierdo', 'firstname': 'Roberto', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York 13214, USA. izquierr@upstate.edu'}, {'lastname': 'Lagua', 'firstname': 'Carina T', 'initials': 'CT', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Meyer', 'firstname': 'Suzanne', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ploutz-Snyder', 'firstname': 'Robert J', 'initials': 'RJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Palmas', 'firstname': 'Walter', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Eimicke', 'firstname': 'Joseph P', 'initials': 'JP', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kong', 'firstname': 'Jian', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Teresi', 'firstname': 'Jeanne A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Shea', 'firstname': 'Steven', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Weinstock', 'firstname': 'Ruth S', 'initials': 'RS', 'affiliation': None}]",20151772,ca2a5a8d-0233-448e-84a0-d6d23766892a,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""Diabetes Technol Ther"""

37966986,Boch et al.,Investigating the Impact of Mindfulness Meditation on Stress Reduction and Self-Compassion of Nursing Health Care Professionals in a Small Community Hospital in the Midwest: A Pilot Study.,"Coronavirus-19 exacerbated daily stressors for nurses due to long hours, understaffing, and potential burnout in health care personnel. There is evidence that nurses who participate in mindfulness activities may experience significant changes related to stress, anxiety, and mood; however, more quantitative research studies are needed to investigate and substantiate the impact of mindfulness-based interventions. This intervention investigated the impact of a 4-week mindfulness meditation on perceived stress and self-compassion. Thirty-two participants were enrolled at the beginning of the study and 26 completed the intervention (intervention group, n = 17; control group, n = 9). A 2-tailed Mann-Whitney U sample rank-sum test was used to explore differences between groups on the 2 outcome variables-Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Self-Compassion Scale (SC). Postintervention assessments were conducted, and statistically significant differences were found between the intervention and control groups for 2 constructs. The intervention group was more likely to ""feel confident handling problems"" (PSS#4) versus the control group (median = 11.76, 16.78, respectively; P = .020; α = .05); and the intervention group tended to ""take a more balanced view of life situations"" (SC#3) than the control group (median = 12.50, 15.39, respectively; P =.047; α = .05). Other constructs from the PSS and the SC were not statistically different.

32840621,Ameli et al.,Effect of a Brief Mindfulness-Based Program on Stress in Health Care Professionals at a US Biomedical Research Hospital: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Stress among health care professionals is well documented. The use of mindfulness-based interventions to reduce stress has shown promising results; however, the time commitment of typical programs can be a barrier to successful implementation in health care settings.
To determine the efficacy and feasibility of a brief mindfulness-based program to reduce stress during work hours among health care professionals.
This intent-to-treat randomized clinical trial was conducted among full-time health care professionals at the Clinical Center at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, between September 2017 and May 2018. Participants were randomized to receive mindfulness-based self-care (MBSC) training or life-as-usual control. Data were analyzed from June 2018 to January 2020.
The MBSC intervention included 5 weekly, 1.5-hour in-class mindfulness practice sessions.
Stress level was the primary outcome, assessed with the Perceived Stress Scale 10-Item version. Secondary outcomes included anxiety, burnout, positive and negative affect, mindfulness (trait and state), and self-care. Assessments were taken at baseline and at the end of the intervention (week 5) in the intervention and control groups, and at follow-up (week 13) in the intervention group to test for a maintenance effect. A postprogram evaluation was also obtained.
Of 82 randomized participants, 78 who completed the study at week 5 were included in the modified intent-to-treat analysis (median [interquartile range] age, 32 [23-48] years; 65 [83%] women), including 43 participants in the MBSC group and 35 participants in the control group. At the end of the intervention, compared with the control group, the MBSC group had reduced levels of stress (mean [SD] score, 17.29 [5.84] vs 18.54 [6.30]; P = .02) and anxiety (mean [SD] score, 2.58 [1.52] vs 4.23 [1.73]; P < .001), and improved positive affect (mean [SD] score, 35.69 [7.12] vs 31.42 [7.27]; P < .001), state mindfulness (mean [SD] score, 3.74 [1.18] vs 2.78 [1.16]; P < .001), and mindful self-care (mean [SD] score, 7.29 [2.44] vs 5.54 [2.77]; P < .001). Burnout, negative affect, and trait mindfulness levels did not differ between groups. Changes within the MBSC group through follow-up included sustained reductions in stress (change, -6.14; 95% CI, -7.84 to -4.44; P < .001), anxiety (change, -1.46; 95% CI, -1.97 to -0.94; P < .001), trait mindfulness (change, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.90; P < .001), and state mindfulness (change, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.39 to 2.39; P < .001).
This randomized clinical trial found that this brief mindfulness-based intervention was an effective and feasible means to reduce stress in health care professionals. Larger studies are needed to assess the effects on clinical care and patient outcomes.

22010779,"Geary, Rosenthal","Sustained impact of MBSR on stress, well-being, and daily spiritual experiences for 1 year in academic health care employees.","The objectives of the study were (1) to evaluate self-reported stress levels and daily spiritual experiences in academic health care employees before, immediately after, and 1 year after enrolling in a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) course; and (2) to evaluate the correlation between a potential measure of pulse rate variability and self-reported stress levels.
Fifty-nine (59) participants in the MBSR course offered to employees at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston (UTMB) comprised the intervention group, and 94 health care providers in the neonatal nurseries comprised the control group.
MBSR is an 8-week course that introduces mindfulness meditation practices. No intervention was offered to the control group. All participants were employees (or relatives of employees) at UTMB.
All MBSR participants completed Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale, the SCL-90, the SF-36 Measure of Health and Well-Being, the Daily Spiritual Experiences Scale, and a 5-minute measure of pulse rate coherence. This testing was done before and after the MBSR course and 1 year later. Ninety-four (94) neonatal health care providers completed the same series of questionnaires and pulse rate variability (PRV) measures, with 49 of the 94 completing the questionnaires 2 months and 1 year later.
MBSR participants improved on all measures except the physical component score of the SF-36 upon completion of the MBSR course, and these results were maintained at the 1-year follow-up. The control group did not significantly change on any of the measures. PRV as measured by the Heart Math system did not correlate with any of the self-report questionnaires.
MBSR effectively reduces self-report measures of stress and increases daily spiritual experiences in employees in an academic health care setting, and these effects are stable for at least 1 year. Using a simple measure of PRV was not a clinically reliable biologic measure of stress.",[],"Journal of alternative and complementary medicine (New York, N.Y.)",10.1089/acm.2010.0335,2011-10-21,"[{'lastname': 'Geary', 'firstname': 'Cara', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX 77550, USA. cageary@utmb.edu'}, {'lastname': 'Rosenthal', 'firstname': 'Susan L', 'initials': 'SL', 'affiliation': None}]",22010779,f138bab8-a07b-4b23-b460-6550802e8322,,"NOFORMAT: No URL format for journal ""J Altern Complement Med"""
20129713,Franco Justo,[Reducing stress levels and anxiety in primary-care physicians through training and practice of a mindfulness meditation technique].,"To check the effectiveness of a mindfulness development meditation technique on stress and anxiety in a group of primary-care physicians.
Quasi-experimental with pretest/posttest/follow-up measurements in a control group and an experimental group. SITE: University of Almeria.
38 primary-care physicians enrolled in a Teaching Aptitude Course (CAP).
An experimental group and a control group were formed with 19 participants in each. The experimental group took a psycho-educational meditation program for training and practice in mindfulness.
The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Strain Questionnaire and the State-Trait Anxiety Questionnaire were used to measure stress and anxiety levels.
A comparative statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney non-parametric U test, finding a significant reduction in all the primary-care physician stress and anxiety variables in the experimental group compared to the control group in pretest-posttest and follow-up tests.
The results of this study support the effectiveness of mindfulness development meditation techniques in decreasing stress and anxiety in primary-care physicians. Nevertheless, the study shows various limitations that would have to be corrected in successive studies to bring more validity to the results.
Evaluar la eficacia de una técnica de meditación para el desarrollo de la conciencia plena (mindfulness) sobre los niveles de estrés y ansiedad en un grupo de médicos de atención primaria.
Cuasiexperimental con un grupo control y un grupo experimental.
Universidad de Almería.
Treinta y ocho médicos de atención primaria (19 en el grupo experimental y 19 en el grupo control) matriculados en el curso para la obtención del Certificado de Aptitud Pedagógica.
El grupo experimental recibió un programa psicoeducativo de meditación para el entrenamiento y práctica de la conciencia plena.
Para la medición de los niveles de estrés y ansiedad se emplearon la escala de estrés percibido, el cuestionario Strain y el cuestionario de ansiedad estado-rasgo.
Se observó una reducción significativa en el grupo experimental en comparación con el grupo control en todas las variables que evaluaban los niveles de estrés y ansiedad de los médicos de atención primaria al comparar sus puntuaciones pretest-postest y pretest-seguimiento.
Los resultados de la presente investigación son un apoyo a la eficacia de las técnicas de meditación para el desarrollo de la conciencia plena para la disminución de los niveles de estrés y ansiedad en médicos de atención primaria. No obstante, el estudio presenta varias limitaciones que habría que subsanar en sucesivas investigaciones para dotar de mayor validez a los resultados obtenidos.",[],Atencion primaria,10.1016/j.aprim.2009.10.020,2010-02-05,"[{'lastname': 'Franco Justo', 'firstname': 'Clemente', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Psicología Evolutiva y de la Educación, Universidad de Almería, Almería, Spain. cfranco@ual.es'}]","20129713
